All of the eight tracks are smooth, mellow studio performances from Miles and his various companions.\n\n\nI ran my line directly through my higher end JVC cassette deck with Dolby ON, as it is a Dolby cassette. No receiver involved. 16-48 FLACS level 8, fully tagged.\n\n\n\na1 Bye Bye Blackbird\na2 Old Folks\na3 Circle\na4 Stella By Starlight\nb1 I Thought About You\nb2 Fall\nb3 All Of You\nb4 Blue In Green\n\n\nEnjoy, and please seed if you at all can!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3792e1b4513fe28ebb900c65f658d5c2202c1a53","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+-+Plays+Classic+Ballads+%28cassette%29+16-48+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3792e1b4513fe28ebb900c65f658d5c2202c1a53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,146,225,180,81,63,226,142,187,144,12,101,246,88,213,194,32,44,26,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
