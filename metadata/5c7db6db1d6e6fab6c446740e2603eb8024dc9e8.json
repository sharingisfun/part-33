The compilation gathers material from Harry's four solo albums for the Chrysalis label, KooKoo, Rockbird, Def, Dumb &amp; Blonde, and Debravation; and unlike 1998's Deborah Harry Collection, it contains most of the singles issued between the years 1981 and 1993, including Harry's biggest solo hits &quot;French Kissin' in the USA&quot; and &quot;I Want That Man&quot;. Most of All also includes non-album singles like &quot;Rush Rush&quot;, &quot;Feel the Spin&quot;, and her 1990 duet with Iggy Pop, &quot;Well, Did You Evah!&quot;, as well alternative single mixes not available on the regular studio albums.  With the new millennium only one month away, EMI issued remixed dance versions of Harry's 1989 hit &quot;I Want That Man&quot; to promote the album, with the updated mixes by D-Bop and Almighty both cleverly accentuating the first line of the chorus: &quot;...here comes the twenty-first century....&quot;. Most Of All concludes with two of these mixes.\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] I Want That Man\n[02] French Kissin' In The USA\n[03] Brite Side\n[04] Sweet And Low (Single Remix Edit)\n[05] Free To Fall\n[06] Well Did You Evah! - - - Deborah Harry &amp; Iggy Pop\n[07] I Can See Clearly\n[08] Strike Me Pink\n[09] Communion (7'' Edit)\n[10] Backfired\n[11] In Love With Love (Saw Remix)\n[12] Rush, Rush\n[13] The Jam Was Moving\n[14] Feel The Spin\n[15] Maybe For Sure\n[16] Rockbird\n[17] I Want That Man (Almighty Definitive Mix Radio Edit)\n[18] I Want That Man (D-Bop 11.59 Vocal Mix Radio Edit)\n\nCD01 Play Time - h:m:s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 186mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
