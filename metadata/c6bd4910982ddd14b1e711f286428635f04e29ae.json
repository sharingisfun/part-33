From 1974 to 1985, Salsoul released about 300 disco 12-inch singles, and a string of albums. Artists such as Instant Funk, Loleatta Holloway, Carol Williams, Jocelyn Brown, Double Exposure, First Choice, Joe Bataan, the Salsoul Orchestra (led by Vincent Montana Jr), Inner Life, Skyy, and Charo were at one time part of their roster.\n\nSalsoul released the first commercially available 12-inch single, Double Exposure's Ten Percent, in 1976. Salsoul Records also manufactured and distributed Gold Mind Records' output. Because of the resurgent interest prompted by Marky Mark and Black Box recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the label's catalogue has been digitally remastered. It is notably more popular in Europe and the United Kingdom than in the United States.\n\nThe label's name was conceived by artist Joe Bataan, who recorded some of the earliest sessions for the Cayre brothers (predating the label's formation). &quot;Salsoul&quot; was street lingo for the musical culture of urban Latinos who were absorbing African-American popular music and infusing into their own culture, as well as vice-versa. Bataan had chosen the name for an LP he made for the Cayre brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCD 1\n-----------------------------------------------------\n01 - Candido - Jingo\n02 - Loleatta Holloway - Love Sensation\n03 - Instant Funk - I Got My Mind Made Up\n04 - The Salsoul Orchestra - Runaway\n05 - First Love - Dr. Love\n06 - Double Exposure - Ten Percent\n07 - Inner Life - Moment Of My Life\n08 - Skyy - Call Me\n09 - First Choice - Love Thang\n10 - Gary Criss - Rio De Janeiro\n11 - True Example - Love Is Finally Coming My Way\n\n\n\nCD 2\n-----------------------------------------------------\n01 - Joe Bataan - The Bottle\n02 - First Choice - Let No Man Put Asunder\n03 - Bebu Silvetti - Spring Rain\n04 - Moment Of Truth - Helpessly\n05 - Loleatta Holloway - Dreamin'\n06 - The Salsoul Orchestra - Salsoul Hustle\n07 - Carol Williams - Love Is You\n08 - Inner Life - Ain't No Mountain High Enough\n09 - Loleatta Holloway - Hit &amp; Run\n10 - Judy Cheeks - Mellow Lovin'\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel: FM / Salsoul\nReleased: 1998\n\n\n\nCodec: Flac\nCompression Level: 5\nQuality: High\n\n\nCD-rips by alekow (EAC and Flac)\nCovers Included (400dpi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, Seed and Share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6bd4910982ddd14b1e711f286428635f04e29ae","amp;dn":"VA+-+Salsoul+Hustle+%2821+Dance+Classics+From+Salsoul+Catalogue%29%40f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6bd4910982ddd14b1e711f286428635f04e29ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,189,73,16,152,45,221,20,177,231,17,242,134,66,134,53,240,78,41,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
