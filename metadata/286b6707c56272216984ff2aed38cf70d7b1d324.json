Disoriented and confused, she remembers only two things: the person who trapped her in dragon form and locked her in the grave - Rhapsody - and an all-encompassing desire to wreak vengeance.\n\nThis is the fifth in the Symphony of Ages series. Like the others, I've cleaned up the audio, chapterized the book, and updated all the tags. This series is, for me, a test to see how much the community likes this sort of thing. If it gets a strong positive response, I've got tons of other books I've done the same thing too I'd love to share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:286b6707c56272216984ff2aed38cf70d7b1d324","amp;dn":"Elegy+for+a+Lost+Star+-+Elizabeth+Haydon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"286b6707c56272216984ff2aed38cf70d7b1d324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,107,103,7,197,98,114,33,105,132,255,42,237,56,207,112,215,177,211,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
