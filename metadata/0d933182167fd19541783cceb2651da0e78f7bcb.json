The authors introduce all of the important components of checkpoint controls, describe their intricate interactions, and highlight the relevance of these processes to the cancer problem. Additional chapters illustrate the advantages of using such diverse model systems as intact human skin, knockout mice, Xenopus, and yeast, and show how they can cross-fertilize and accelerate research both across disciplines and beyond the boundaries of a particular species. A second volume, Activation and Regulation Protocols, provides readily reproducible experimental protocols to study the molecular components of checkpoint controls and their regulation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d933182167fd19541783cceb2651da0e78f7bcb","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2004%5D+Checkpoint+Controls+and+Cancer%2C+Volume+1+%2B+2+Review","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d933182167fd19541783cceb2651da0e78f7bcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,147,49,130,22,127,209,149,65,120,60,206,178,101,29,160,231,143,123,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
