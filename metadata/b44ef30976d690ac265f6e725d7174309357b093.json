The sound is warm and spacious and the orchestral playing immaculate. \n\nBohm shapes the performances lovingly; allegros are never forced; the adagios have never sounded more beautiful; the minuets are charming and the finales, while never rushed, have plenty of excitement. As one would expect for a close friend and associate of Richard Strauss [also a great Mozartian] the orchestral textures are clear and do not at all show the 'muddiness' one might expect from a 'big band' like the Berlin Philharmonic. Also, I was continually amazed by Bohm's felicities of phrasing. Nothing sounds exaggerated and there are none of those clever 'original touches' delighted in by some conductors - 'touches' that become increasingly irritating on repeat listenings. \n\nA different sound to 'original instrument' Mozart - of course - but these performances from forty years ago do not sound in the slightest bit dated \nand can be recommended without reservation.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b44ef30976d690ac265f6e725d7174309357b093","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+The+46+Symphonies+%28Karl+Bohm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b44ef30976d690ac265f6e725d7174309357b093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,78,243,9,118,214,144,172,38,95,110,114,93,113,116,48,147,87,176,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
