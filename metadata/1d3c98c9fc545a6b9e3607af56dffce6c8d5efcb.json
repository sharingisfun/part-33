Set during the Lanna period, a mysterious murder takes place in the woods. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the killing itself that sparks the controversy but the strange trial that ensues where the event is told from the different perspective of three witnesses; a monk, a woodcutter and an undertaker. With contradicting versions of what happened, the classic story explores time-honoured themes like truth and morality amidst difficult circumstances.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d3c98c9fc545a6b9e3607af56dffce6c8d5efcb","amp;dn":"U+Mong+Pa+Meung+%5B+VCD+%5D+nosub+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d3c98c9fc545a6b9e3607af56dffce6c8d5efcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,60,152,201,252,84,90,107,158,54,7,175,86,223,252,230,200,213,239,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
