First, the cooks' raw talent is put to the test with a sushi platter in the appetizer basket. Then in the entree round, do the home chefs have what it takes to take ostrich fillets and blueberry wine and create remarkable dishes? Lastly, after the dessert round, the judges are left to compare two very similar plates.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 26-Feb-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20b7e2dd5fa0ee25b7cc184c268dc9b5d9e01aa2","amp;dn":"Chopped.S13E18.Untrained.Undaunted.HDTV.XviD-pwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20b7e2dd5fa0ee25b7cc184c268dc9b5d9e01aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,183,226,221,95,160,238,37,183,204,24,76,38,141,201,181,217,224,26,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
