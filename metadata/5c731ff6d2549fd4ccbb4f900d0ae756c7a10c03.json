Ryan's alpha-male boss, Stephen, played by John Cho, has a different plan in store for Ryan, making him attend grief counseling before returning to the air. A reluctant Ryan finds himself in a support group for &quot;life change,&quot; where he meets an oddball cast of characters, all with their own backstories filled with varying degrees of loss.\n\nOn his very first visit, Ryan convinces the group to deviate from their normal session and starts a tournament-style competition (March Sadness!) to find out whose story is the worst. Ryan's total lack of interest in &quot;the healing process&quot; proves distracting and he soon butts heads with the by-the-books group leader, Lauren, played by Tony Award-winner Laura Benanti. Back at work, Ryan is confronted with the fact that he hasn't really processed his grief and realizes Lauren and the other members of the group might be key in helping him move on.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c731ff6d2549fd4ccbb4f900d0ae756c7a10c03","amp;dn":"Go.On.S01E22.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c731ff6d2549fd4ccbb4f900d0ae756c7a10c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,115,31,246,210,84,159,212,204,187,79,144,13,10,231,86,199,161,12,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
