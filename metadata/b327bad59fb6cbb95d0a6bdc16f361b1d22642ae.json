With The JuJu Beans, attitude is the key. That attitude transforms itself into totally unpretentious, thoroughly energizing, immensely satisfying recordings and shows that will keep you dancin' til dawn. So, if you like rockin' rhythm &amp; blues played like it was in the 50's and early 60's, with no compromise, then you'll love The JuJu Beans.\n\n\nwww.thejujubeans.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b327bad59fb6cbb95d0a6bdc16f361b1d22642ae","amp;dn":"The+JuJu+Beans+Live+at+O%27Riley%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b327bad59fb6cbb95d0a6bdc16f361b1d22642ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,39,186,213,159,182,203,185,93,10,107,220,22,243,97,177,210,38,66,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
