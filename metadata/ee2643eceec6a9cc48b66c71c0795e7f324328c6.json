Their beautiful, mist-shrouded town seems almost stuck in time, and all three women lead seemingly quiet, uneventful existences. But they are harboring a mighty secret - they are powerful witches banned from using their magic. Joanna can resurrect people from the dead and heal the most serious of injuries. Ingrid, her bookish daughter, has the ability to predict the future and weave knots that can solve anything from infertility to infidelity. And finally, there's Freya, the wild child, who has a charm or a potion that can cure most any heartache.\n\nUnabridged.\nRead By Katie Schorr.\n\n------------------------------------------\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee2643eceec6a9cc48b66c71c0795e7f324328c6","amp;dn":"Witches+of+East+End+-+Melissa+De+La+Cruz+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee2643eceec6a9cc48b66c71c0795e7f324328c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,38,67,236,238,198,169,204,72,182,108,113,192,121,94,127,50,67,40,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
