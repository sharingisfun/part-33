Berkowitz said,\n&quot;We went back and forth comparing the new mono LPs and CDs with the original LPs.\nThey were the 'masters' we served to replicate.&quot;\n\nThe Original Mono Recordings&quot; box sets of 180-gram LPs are both accompanied by a beautifully illustrated booklet,\nfeaturing vintage photographs of Dylan.\n\n=====================================\n\nAlbum List\n\nBob Dylan (1962)\nThe FreeWheelin' Bob Dylan (1963)\nThe Times They Are A-Changin' (1964)\nAnother Side Of Bob Dylan (1964)\nBringing It All Back Home (1965)\nHighway 61 Revisited (1965)\nBlonde on Blonde (1966)\nJohn Wesley Harding (1967)\n\n========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nAlbum : Bob Dylan (Mono Vinyl Box)\nAlbum/Performer : Bob Dylan\nComposer : Bukka White\nGenre : Folk\n\n\n=====================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 1 749 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\nWriting library : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a09b993cea4f6f03cd74a19165990cc0c706810","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Mono+Box+Collection+%282010%29+-+Flac+%7B24+Bit+96+KHz+Vin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a09b993cea4f6f03cd74a19165990cc0c706810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,9,185,147,206,164,246,240,60,215,74,25,22,89,144,204,12,112,104,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
