It was directed by F. W. Murnau, photographed by Karl Freund and written by Carl Mayer from MoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re's original play.\n\nThe film starred Emil Jannings as Tartuffe, Lil Dagover as Elmire and Werner Krauss as Orgon.\n\nAlthough retaining the basic plot, Murnau and Mayer pared down MoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re's play, eliminating most of the secondary characters and concentrating on the triangle of Orgon, Elmire and Tartuffe. They also introduced a framing device, whereby the story of Tartuffe becomes a film-within-a-film, shown by a young actor as a device to warn his grandfather about his unctuous but evil housekeeper.\n\nIMDB: 7.4/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0017448/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://us.imdb.com/title/tt0017448/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
