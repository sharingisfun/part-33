While on Earth, they kidnap two lively children that lead the group of Martians to the North Pole and Santa. The Martians then take Santa and the two children back to Mars with them. Voldar, a particularly grumpy Martian, attempts to do away with the children and Santa before they get to Mars, but their leader Lomas stops him. When they arrive on Mars, Santa, with the help of the two Earth children and a rather simple-minded Martian lackey, overcomes the Martians by bringing fun, happiness and Christmas cheer to the children of Mars.\n\nColour/1964","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031d4229b08f00cf08b34321fc0c74bdae7128b8","amp;dn":"Santa+Claus+Conquers+The+Martians+%281964+B-Flick-DVD-Rip%29+-%2B-FoX-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031d4229b08f00cf08b34321fc0c74bdae7128b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,29,66,41,176,143,0,207,8,179,67,33,252,12,116,189,174,113,40,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
