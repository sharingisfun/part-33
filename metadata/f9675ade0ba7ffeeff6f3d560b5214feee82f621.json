John O'Regan's debut album as Diamond Rings, Special Affections, was bursting with that kind of quirky appeal - as well as rock-solid songwriting - which earned him critical acclaim and tours with the likes of Robyn. So when it emerged that O'Regan had recruited producer Damian Taylor, who had previously worked with such big-sounding artists as BjÃƒÂ¶rk and the Killers, to work on his second album, there was a justifiable concern that what made his first album great could get lost in translation. While some of Special Affections' fake-it-till-you-make-it moxie is missing from Free Dimensional, the album mostly just sounds like a bigger, bolder version of the voice O'Regan set forth on his debut.  While Special Affections' indie charm is missed here and there, Free Dimensional lives up to its name by serving up lots of sparkling pop with depth as well as heart and brains. O'Regan might not be indie anymore, but he remains independent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9675ade0ba7ffeeff6f3d560b5214feee82f621","amp;dn":"Diamond+Rings+-+Free+Dimensional+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9675ade0ba7ffeeff6f3d560b5214feee82f621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,103,90,222,11,167,255,238,255,111,61,86,11,82,20,254,238,130,246,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
