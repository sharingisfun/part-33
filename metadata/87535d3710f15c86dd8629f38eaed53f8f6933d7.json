With Covers.\n\n\nWhen Chet Atkins first heard Vernon Oxford, he said, ''I didn't know there was any of them left.'' The irony is that Vernon was too country for country music. He came to Nashville in 1963 playing and singing in the old way, and he made some of the best country music from the '60s and '70s. Recognized overseas more than at home, he only had one major hit, Redneck. It's here with all his RCA recordings, as well as singles he made for small labels like Omni and Stop. The 142 titles including Watermelon Time In Georgia, Woman Let Me Sing You A Song, Nashville Women, Baby Sister, Hazard County Saturday Night, Good Old Fashioned Saturday Night Honky Tonk Barroom Brawl, as well as the original version of Brother Jukebox. The set is rounded out with the three superlative Rounder albums and our vintage Bear Family LP. Country music comes no more soulful - and no more country!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87535d3710f15c86dd8629f38eaed53f8f6933d7","amp;dn":"Vernon+Oxford+-+Keeper+Of+The+Flame+%5B1965-1981%5D+Bear+Family+5CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87535d3710f15c86dd8629f38eaed53f8f6933d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,83,93,55,16,241,92,134,221,134,41,243,142,174,213,63,143,105,51,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
