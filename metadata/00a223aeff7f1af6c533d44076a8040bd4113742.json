His journey reveals that this state-of-the-art aircraft owes as much to weapons of war, Mother Nature and household objects as it does to high technology. He discovers that a bicycle pump, a 19th-century rocket, an ancient Mongolian bow and an eagle's wing are all hidden in its secret DNA.\n\n2)  Taipei 101 \nRichard Hammond travels to Taipei and discovers the secrets of the Taipei 101 skyscraper. This modern marvel of engineering stands at a jaw-dropping 1671 feet. Built on top of a seismic fault line and in a typhoon hotspot, its height is all the more impressive given its location. Richard discovers just what it is in the Taipei 101's DNA that allows it be so tall and cope with these extreme natural events, and what all this cutting-edge engineering has in common with a bird cage, bamboo, boat masts and seat belts. Richard embarks on a fantastic journey of discovery that will take him from the mines of 17th-century England via the early skyscrapers of Chicago to the top of one of the most advanced buildings in the world.\n\n3)  Keck Observatory \nRichard Hammond journeys to discover the startling engineering connections behind the Keck Observatory, which has seen further into the universe than any other telescope on earth. He reveals that the observatory owes its incredible design to an ancient Greek ritual, an early twentieth-century Russian inventor, an American Civil War general, a breakthrough in aerial reconnaissance and an attempt to cure yellow fever. Hidden in its DNA he finds an ancient technique for lighting a flame, a weird-sounding musical instrument, a sandblaster, a Korean spy plane and a refrigerator.\n\n4)  Troll a Gas Platform \nRichard Hammond journeys to discover the startling engineering connections behind the Troll A gas platform, the largest object ever moved by man across the surface of the Earth. During his voyage, he reveals that Troll A owes its incredible design to a 19th-century French gardener, a 16th-century German mayor, an American architect and the dawn of the motor industry. Hidden in its DNA, he finds a crystal glass, a farm building, a racing car, a plant pot and nothing!\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img227.imageshack.us/img227/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img227.imageshack.us/img227/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/5859/engineeringconnectionss.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/4941/engineeringconnectionssu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/4941/engineeringconnectionssu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/4941/engineeringconnectionssu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/4941/engineeringconnectionssu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/6681/engineeringconnectionsse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/6681/engineeringconnectionsse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/5927/engineeringconnectionssl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/5927/engineeringconnectionssl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/7118/engineeringconnectionssg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img231.imageshack.us/img231/7118/engineeringconnectionssg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1798 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 704x400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 50:06.mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 715 MB\n * Subtitles: None\n * Ripped by: artistharry\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hammond%27s_Engineering_Connections&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hammond%27s_Engineering_Connections&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_101&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_A_platform&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_A_platform&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a223aeff7f1af6c533d44076a8040bd4113742","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Engineering+Connections+Series+1+3of4+Keck+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a223aeff7f1af6c533d44076a8040bd4113742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,162,35,174,255,127,26,246,197,51,212,64,118,168,4,11,212,17,55,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
