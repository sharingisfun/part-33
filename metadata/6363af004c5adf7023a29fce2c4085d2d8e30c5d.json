And all operations performed on the operating system are completely safe, because all changes are monitored by TuneUp Rescue Center and can be undone at any time. All TuneUp Utilities modules can be accessed through a common interface that is divided into six categories. In addition, the main window also has three general buttons in a dark gray bar to the right at the top of the window. Pressing the first button starts the TuneUp Rescue Center module. The second button starts the TuneUp Update Wizard, which can be used to update TuneUp Utilities 2009 to the latest version over the Internet. The last button provides help and settings that you can use to customize the software package to meet your needs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6363af004c5adf7023a29fce2c4085d2d8e30c5d","amp;dn":"TuneUp+Utilities+2013+English+%2813.0.2013.194+Final%29-patch-iOTA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6363af004c5adf7023a29fce2c4085d2d8e30c5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,99,175,0,76,90,223,112,35,162,159,206,44,64,133,210,216,227,12,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
