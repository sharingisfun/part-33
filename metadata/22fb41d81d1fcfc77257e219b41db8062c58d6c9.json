The titles in the Britannica Guide to the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Most Influential People series are arranged chronologically. For example, The 100 Most Influential Women of All Time begins with Hatshepsut and ends with Diana, Princess of Wales. Overall, the selections offer a good balance of gender, nationality, and ethnicity. Articles, a mix of new content and content drawn from BritannicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s repository, generally range from two to five pages and are headed with date and place of birth and, where applicable, death. There are no article-specific bibliographies or references. Each volume concludes with a glossary, a brief further-reading list, and an index. Although not visually enticing, these volumes offer trustworthy information in convenient packages and would be useful in high-school and public libraries. Other series resulting from the Rosen-Britannica partnership include America at War, An ExplorerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide to the Universe, Islamic History, Turning Points in History, and U. S.
