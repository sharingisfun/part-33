It's a 'mood' piece from frame one with relevant back story fed to us via an eye dropper and none the worse for that. She is also very consistent and sure-footed in her narrative. For instance our first glimpse of Arestrup is of an ageing father figure in mid-metamorphose from 'insensitive' to 'monster' yet in the back story he is seen through the same eyes - initially a bruised wife but now a young girl in love - as a caring, sensitive romantic. Okay, we're talking art house fare but that's what we don't have enough of. As an actress Sophie Marceau was often associated with the type of movie that held no interest for me, fodder for the bubble-gum crowd, but as a writer-director she is a double-threat on whom I will keep an eye. See it only if you're discerning and value fine writing, acting and directing.\n\nFile: Parlez-Moi D'amour 2002.avi\nFilesize: 698.01 Mb ( 731Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 912Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 192 bytes )\nPlay length: 01:34:37.959 (141949 frames)\nSubtitles: Present (SubRip format)\nVideo: 576x304 (1.89:1), 25 fps, DivX ;-) MPEG-4 Low-Motion ~890 kbps avg, 0.20 bit/pixel\nAudio: 44.100 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~128.00 kbps avg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abdc3c255cc75c6ab50adb746b56efa9f6524845","amp;dn":"+Parlez-moi+d%5C%27amour+%5B2002%5D+dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abdc3c255cc75c6ab50adb746b56efa9f6524845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,220,60,37,92,199,92,106,181,10,219,116,107,86,239,169,246,82,72,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
