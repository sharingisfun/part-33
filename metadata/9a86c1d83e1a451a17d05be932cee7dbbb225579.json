Seven teens were arrested for the crimes, and instantly became tabloid fodder. The world asked-how did the American obsession with celebrity get so out of hand? And why did a band of ostensibly privileged LA teens take such a risk?\n\nVanity Fair reporter Nancy Jo Sales found the answer: they did it because they could. And because it was just that easy.\n\nAuthor of the acclaimed Vanity Fair story on the Bling Ring &quot;The Suspect Wore Louboutins,&quot; Sales gained unprecedented access to the Hollywood thieves, and in the process uncovered a dark world of teenage arrogance, greed, obsession, and delusion. Now, for the first time in a full book length work, Sales details the Bling Ring crimes up close and in depth, and reveals the key players' stories in a shocking look at the seedy world of the real young Hollywood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a86c1d83e1a451a17d05be932cee7dbbb225579","amp;dn":"The+Bling+Ring+-+Nancy+Jo+Sales.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a86c1d83e1a451a17d05be932cee7dbbb225579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,134,193,216,62,26,69,26,23,208,91,233,50,206,231,219,187,34,85,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
