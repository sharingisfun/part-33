The American release was \r\nthe very first album released by DreamWorks Records. It was his first album since 1990s \r\nListen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1 â€“ the five-and-a-half-year gap was due to the \r\ncontroversial legal battle that Michael experienced with his record company. Michael \r\ndedicated three years straight in the recording of Older, and the album found him exploring \r\nnew musical territories in a more serious fashion compared to his previous work.\r\n\r\n\r\n01 - No Son Of Mine [06:40]\r\n02 - Jesus He Knows Me [04:16]\r\n03 - Driving The Last Spike [10:08]\r\n04 - I Can't Dance [04:00]\r\n05 - Never A Time [03:50]\r\n06 - Dreaming While You Sleep [07:16]\r\n07 - Tell Me Why [04:58]\r\n08 - Living Forever [05:40]\r\n09 - Hold On My Heart [04:37]\r\n10 - Way Of The World [05:39]\r\n11 - Since I Lost You [04:09]\r\n12 - Fading Lights [10:15]\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: George Michael\r\nGenre: Pop / Soul\r\nAlbum Release Year: 1996\r\nLabel: Virgin, DreamWorks\r\nASIN:: 2438413922\r\nNumber of Tracks:12\r\nTotal Duration: 58:56.760\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate: 923 kbps [Average Bit Rate]\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 L/R [Full Stereo]\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Source: Original CDs &gt; FLAC\r\nConverter: EAC V1.1 Test And Copy Secure Mode\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\r\nIncluded Artwork: [Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files]\r\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheets FLAC &amp; WAV, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP,foo_dr, and M3U\r\nTotal File Size:392 MB\r\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c697742d510d552982923a5ba24a2a5bbe2be22","amp;dn":"George+Michael+-+Older+%5B1996%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c697742d510d552982923a5ba24a2a5bbe2be22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,105,119,66,213,16,213,82,152,41,35,165,186,36,162,165,187,226,190,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
