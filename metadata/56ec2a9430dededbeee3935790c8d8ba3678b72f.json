Although not the most significant group that the drummer led, this edition (with trumpeter Joe Gordon, tenor saxophonist Richie Kamuca, pianist Victor Feldman, and bassist Monty Budwig) was certainly capable of playing high-quality bebop. Originally their output was released on four LPs; the reissue expanded the music to five CDs. The first volume adds an alternate take of Frank Rosolino's &quot;Blue Daniel&quot; to a set that includes swinging versions of &quot;Blue Daniel,&quot; &quot;Poinciana,&quot; &quot;Our Delight,&quot; and &quot;Summertime.&quot; The extended performances are easily recommended to straight-ahead jazz fans. ~ AllMusic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n&quot;Now, what can be said about this great hipster, club owner and breeder of horses? His musicality was unparalleled, always unassuming, always serving the music. He almost singlehandedly defined West Coast Jazz, he played behind everyone who was someone and his music graced tons of TV programs and movies we still love today. These recordings, maybe the finest, most relaxed live recordings I've heard with his Men Joe Gordon, Richie Camuca Monty Budwig and Victor Feldman at his now defunct club serve as a fine testament to the man's genius. &quot;\n\nThis is an essential part of any jazz collection. great smooth sound!  ~ Lee Uecker\n\nPersonnel\nShelly Manne - d\nJoe Gordon - tp\nRichie Kamuca - ts\nVictor Feldman - p\nMonty Budwig - b\n\nShelly Manne &amp; His Men - At The Black Hawk VO1 Tracklist:\n01  Summertime (12:01)\n02  Our Delight (12:04)\n03  Poinciana (13:17)\n04  Blue Daniel (8:44)\n05  Blue Daniel (alternate version) (8:15)\n06  Theme: A Gem From Tiffany (0:50)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56ec2a9430dededbeee3935790c8d8ba3678b72f","amp;dn":"Shelly+Manne+%26amp%3B+His+Men+-+At+The+Black+Hawk+VO1+%281959%29+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56ec2a9430dededbeee3935790c8d8ba3678b72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,236,42,148,48,222,222,219,238,227,147,87,144,200,216,186,54,120,183,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
