The other members were Linda LaFlamme (keyboards), Pattie Santos (vocals), Hal Wagenet (guitar), Mitchell Holman (bass) and Val Fuentes (drums). Although they were one of the earliest and most important San Francisco bands to emerge from 1967's social phenomenon Summer of Love, the band never quite achieved the success of contemporaries such as Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Santana, with whom they had connections. The band created a unique blend of rock, jazz, folk, classical and world beat styles during the initial seven years it was officially together.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a0639d438d24c551392f778f8c6068642830f63","amp;dn":"it%27s+a+beautiful+day-+A+Thousand+and+One+Nights+vinyl+rip+24-96","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a0639d438d24c551392f778f8c6068642830f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,6,57,212,56,210,76,85,19,146,247,120,248,198,6,134,66,131,15,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
