COLEMAN\n              PETROS XANTHOPOULOS\n\n\n\nThis volume covers some of the topics that are related to the rapidly growing \nfield of biomedical informatics. In June 11-12, 2010 a workshop entitled \n`Optimization and Data Analysis in Biomedical Informatics' was organized at \nThe Fields Institute. Following this event, invited contributions were gathered \nbased on the talks presented at the workshop, and additional invited chapters \nwere solicited from leading experts. In this publication, the authors share \ntheir expertise in the form of state-of-the-art research and review chapters, \nbringing together researchers from different disciplines and emphasizing the \nvalue of mathematical methods in the areas of clinical sciences. \n\nThis work is targeted to applied mathematicians, computer scientists, \nindustrial engineers, and clinical scientists who are interested in exploring \nemerging and fascinating interdisciplinary topics of research. It is designed \nto further stimulate and enhance fruitful collaborations between scientists \nfrom different disciplines.?\n\nMore read through the book.......\n\n\nYour review encourage me...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c08ed6c205e5f5aacb79a07a7830214afa7a8ac","amp;dn":"Optimization+and+Data+Analysis+in+Biomedical+Informatics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c08ed6c205e5f5aacb79a07a7830214afa7a8ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,8,237,108,32,94,95,90,172,183,154,7,167,131,2,20,175,167,168,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
