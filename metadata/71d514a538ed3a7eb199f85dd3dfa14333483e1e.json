How did a penniless artist, a young shepherd, and a playboy poet believe they could carry out such a remarkable feat of strength and endurance, smuggling the general past thousands of Nazi pursuers, with little more than their own wits and courage to guide them? \n\nMcDougall makes his way to the island to find the answer and retrace their steps, experiencing firsthand the extreme physical challenges the Resistance fighters and their local allies faced. On Crete, the birthplace of the classical Greek heroism that spawned the likes of Herakles and Odysseus, McDougall discovers the tools of the heroÃ¢â‚¬â€natural movement, extraordinary endurance, and efficient nutrition. All of these skills, McDougall learns, are still practiced in far-flung pockets throughout the world today.\n\nMore than a mystery of remarkable people and cunning schemes, Natural Born Heroes is a fascinating investigation into the lost art of the hero, taking us from the streets of London at midnight to the beaches of Brazil at dawn, from the mountains of Colorado to McDougallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own backyard in Pennsylvania, all places where modern-day athletes are honing ancient skills so theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready for anything. \n\nJust as Born to Run inspired readers to get off the treadmill, out of their shoes, and into the natural world, Natural Born Heroes will inspire them to leave the gym and take their fitness routine to natureÃ¢â‚¬â€to climb, swim, skip, throw, and jump their way to their own heroic feats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d514a538ed3a7eb199f85dd3dfa14333483e1e","amp;dn":"Natural+Born+Heroes+by+Christopher+McDougall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d514a538ed3a7eb199f85dd3dfa14333483e1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,213,20,165,56,237,58,126,177,153,248,93,211,223,161,67,51,72,62,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
