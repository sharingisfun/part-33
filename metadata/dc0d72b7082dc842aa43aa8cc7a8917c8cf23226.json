I have a long working relationship with both Travis and J Bonner. J is my favorite reggae bass player that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve played with and worked with me on PoetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Life and the Jimmy Cliff album. Travis is in the Transplants with me. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so fortunate to get to play with these guys. In the video, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shot of me standing on a garbage can on the corner of Durant and Telegraph, in the distance you can see the church where my parents were married in 1958. This song is dedicated to my dad Don Armstrong 1931-2012\n \n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€ Guitars and Vocals\nTravis Barker Ã¢â‚¬â€ Drums\nJ Bonner Ã¢â‚¬â€ Bass\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€ Keys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc0d72b7082dc842aa43aa8cc7a8917c8cf23226","amp;dn":"Ooh+La+La+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc0d72b7082dc842aa43aa8cc7a8917c8cf23226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,13,114,183,8,45,200,66,170,67,170,140,199,168,145,124,140,242,50,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
