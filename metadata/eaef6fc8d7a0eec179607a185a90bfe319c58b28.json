Robb - Eve Dallas 17 - Purity in Death-viny\n\nNora Roberts (writing as J. D. Robb) delivers the 15th installment in her continuing In Death series, featuring no-nonsense homicide detective Eve Dallas. As with each of these novels, Purity in Death offers a story line that is fresh and compelling but never loses touch with the core components that have made the series such a success: love, loyalty, and justice.\n\n\n\nPurity in Death finds our heroine on an assignment that leaves her even more tormented by the past. When a deadly computer virus is unleashed on society's undesirables (namely, child abusers), it's up to Eve -- along with her astonishingly handsome husband, Roarke; her feisty aide, Peabody; e-geek McNab; and her mentor, Captain Feeny -- to discover the origins of the virus and shut down the clandestine vigilante group that created it before the next target is marked for execution.\n\n\n\nEve's task is complicated further as she grapples with her demons (as a child-abuse victim, it was a matter of survival that led Eve to kill her father) and squares off with Roarke, who does not regard the group's intentions as inherently bad. Once again, she must muddle through those gray areas of right and wrong as she seeks to &quot;stand for the dead,&quot; and answer the question of whether the group is justified in its actions, or whether they simply represent a new breed of terrorist.\n\n\n\nA quick, thrilling, and captivating read, this novel will leave fans pining with anticipation for No. 16.
