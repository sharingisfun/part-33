This represents an imperfect attempt to offset one complaint about the book in a small way, in the very few places where I felt that it could be done without changing or confusing the author's ideas and concepts.\n\nThe issue in question is perhaps best summarized by this XKCD comic, though if you google &quot;XKCD Anathem&quot; you'll find several related discussions of the pros and cons and appropriateness of the quantity and quality of the author's use of neologisms and &quot;made up words.&quot; http://www.xkcd.com/483/\nThis is a good discussion of the pros and cons of Neal's choices etc. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mssv.net/2008/10/06/anathem-and-neologisms/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mssv.net/2008/10/06/anathem-and-neologisms/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo put it briefly, there is an entire glossary in the back of the book of words, most of which are new, fictionalized words. The author made some judgment calls about how and when to translate or neologize different ideas he had about that world and ours, and this is an attempt to correct a very small number of places where I feel the neologisms detract from, rather than adding to, the reader's sense of the world's differences and similarities, specifically those places where I feel there's little to no difference in the meaning and use of the words with more common substitutes.\n\nThe author has this to say about these words, and the connection between Earth and English words, and the planet Arbre and the words used in the book:\n&quot;This story takes place almost four thousand years after the people of Arbre settled on their common system of units, which now seem ancient and time-worn to them. Accordingly, old Earth units (feet, miles, etc.) are used here instead of the newer ones from the metric system.\n&quot;Where the Orth-speaking culture of this book has developed vocabulary based on the ancient precedents of Arbre, I have coined words based on the old languages of Earth. Anathem is the first and most conspicuous example. It is a play on the words anthem and anathema, which derive from Latin and Greek words. Orth, the classical language of Arbre, has a completely different vocabulary, and so the words for anthem, anathema, and anathem are altogether different, and yet linked by a similar pattern of associations. Rather than use the Orth word, which would be devoid of meaning and connotations to Earth readers, I have tried to devise an Earth word that serves as its rough equivalent while preserving some flavor of the Orth term. The same thing, mutatis mutandis, has been done in many other places in the book.\n&quot;Names of some Arbran plant and animal species have been translated into rough Earth equivalents. So these characters may speak of carrots, potatoes, dogs, cats, etc. This doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean that Arbre has exactly the same species. Naturally, Arbre has its own plants and animals. The names of those speciesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rough Earth equivalents have been swapped in here to obviate digressions in which, e.g., the phenotype of the Arbre-equivalent-of-a-carrot must be explained in detail.&quot;\n\nYou can decide for yourself which version you'd prefer to read, and several versions are included here, but to help you decide, here are the entries from the glossary which I substituted other words for, followed by those I left in place. One notable eception I was inclined to change or remove, but found I couldn't do so via simple substitution for one main narrative reason, is the author's use of the term &quot;speely&quot; and &quot;speelycaptor&quot; to mean, basically, &quot;video&quot; and &quot;video camera.&quot; If you don't mind making one point in the narrative early on a little bit incoherent, you could make this substitution via search and replace yourself, along with any others you saw fit to.\n\nREMOVED NEOLOGISMS\nCartabla (replaced by &quot;GPS&quot; or left alone, depending on version): A portable location-finding and map-display gadget, like a GPS unit on Earth.\nDrummon (replaced by &quot;Semi&quot; or &quot;tractor trailer&quot; depending on version)): A large wheeled vehicle used extramuros to transport heavy freight on roads.\nFetch (replaced by &quot;Truck&quot;): A wheeled vehicle used extramuros, typically by artisans, to transport small amounts of freight, tools, etc. Typically larger and less comfortable than a mobe.\nJeejah (replaced by &quot;Mobile&quot;): Ubiquitous handheld electronic device used by SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦culars, combining functions of mobile telephone, camera, network browser, etc. Forbidden in the mathic world.\nMobe (replaced by &quot;Car&quot;): A wheeled passenger vehicle used extramuros.\nSuvin: A school.\nSyndev (replaced by &quot;computer&quot;): Contraction of Syntactic Device. A computer.\nSyntactic Device (replaced by &quot;Computer&quot;): In Earth terms, a computer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f09d3af45efbdc0cf4789711a62ce79c36eeeb1a","amp;dn":"Anathem+%28Neologism+Substitution+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f09d3af45efbdc0cf4789711a62ce79c36eeeb1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,157,58,244,94,251,220,12,244,120,151,17,166,44,231,156,54,238,235,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
