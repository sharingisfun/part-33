He has co-presented with some of the finest renowned authors, healers and spiritual teachers including Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dwyer, Neale Donald Walsch, Julia Cameron, James Redfield and more recently His Holiness the Dalai Lama. His uniquely melodic and distinctive music has also led to recording opportunities with The Eurythmics, Donovan and the Grateful Dead; as well as receiving an invite to perform for HRH Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; plus the King and Queen of Sweden.&quot;\n\nThis particular album was released November 4th, 1986. I originally brought the audio tape version of this with me to Thailand during the early 90's where I was sent to study Buddhism as a teenage boy. That tape is long gone, however it's transporting melodies imprinted upon me and I would often find myself recalling them from memory during times of trial and hardship. A few years ago I tried to find this album again, to no avail, but since then I have finally found it and wanted to share it with other's so that they may benefit from it as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e15486ba6b8b7da43af21fe093bdabbbd586f683","amp;dn":"The+Enchanter+-+Tim+Wheater+-+New+Age+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e15486ba6b8b7da43af21fe093bdabbbd586f683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,84,134,186,107,139,125,164,58,242,31,224,147,189,171,187,213,134,246,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
