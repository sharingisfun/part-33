Similar to what Marillion did for Anoraknophobia, the album was funded by pre-orders of a limited edition of the album before the album was recorded. Those who ordered the album's &quot;Ultra Package&quot; had their names listed in the CD booklet and included as part of the track &quot;Their Names Escape Me&quot;, which is exclusive to the limited edition. The album was released independently in May 2010. A retail and digital release with Mascot Records was released in August 2010. This album is the last studio album recorded with former drummer and vocalist Nick D'Virgilio, who left the band on November 18, 2011 to focus on other commitments.\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Edge of the In-Between&quot; (Dave Meros, John Boegehold) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:30\n    &quot;The Emperor's Clothes&quot; (Alan Morse, Neal Morse, Larry Kutcher) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:01\n    &quot;Kamikaze&quot; (Ryo Okumoto) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n    &quot;From the Darkness&quot; (Nick D'Virgilio, A.
