Musically Florence and the Machine's sound is generally referred to as soul-inspired indie rock. Florence and the Machine's music has received praise across the music media, especially from the BBC who played a large part in Florence and the Machine's rise to prominence by promoting her as part of BBC Introducing.[1] This led to the band playing at a number of music festivals in 2008, including Glastonbury as well as Reading and Leeds and T in the Park. The band's debut album, Lungs was released on 6 July 2009, and held the number 2 position for its first five weeks in the charts, behind Michael Jackson.[2] The album has now been in the top 40 UK charts for 22 consecutive weeks.\n\nLive at MTV Live Session 2009.\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2009 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f786de254cc37f9f642ff62624b73db59de08071","amp;dn":"Florence+And+The+Machine+-+Dog+Days+%28MTV+Live+Sessions+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f786de254cc37f9f642ff62624b73db59de08071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,134,222,37,76,195,127,159,100,47,246,38,36,183,61,181,157,224,128,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
