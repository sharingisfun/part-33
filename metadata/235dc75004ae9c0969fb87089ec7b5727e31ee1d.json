A Bram Stoker Award winner and World Fantasy nominee, Partridge's rapid-fire tale of a small town trapped by its own shadows welcomed a wholly original creation, the October Boy, earning the author comparisons to Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, and Shirley Jackson.\n\nNow Partridge revisits Halloween with a collection featuring a half-dozen stories celebrating frights both past and present. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Jack o' Lantern,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a brand new Dark Harvest novelette, the October Boy races against a remorseless dÃƒÂ¶ppelganger bent on carving a deadly path through the town's annual ritual of death and rebirth. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Johnny HalloweenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features a sheriff battling both a walking ghost and his own haunted conscience. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“Three Doors,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a scarred war hero hunts his past with the help of a magic prosthetic hand, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Satan's ArmyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a real Partridge rarity previously available only in a long sold-out lettered edition from another press.\n\nBut there's more to this holiday celebration besides fiction. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Man Who Killed HalloweenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an extensive essay about growing up during the late sixties in the town where the Zodiac Killer began his murderous spree. In an introduction that explores monsters both fictional and real, Partridge recalls what it was like to live in a community menaced by a serial killer and examines how the Zodiac's reign of terror shaped him as a writer.\n\nHalloween night awaits. Join a master storyteller as he explores the layers of darkness that separate all-too-human evil from the supernatural. Let Norman Partridge lead you on seven journeys through the most dangerous night of the year, where no one is safeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and everyone is suspect.\n\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1587672235\nISBN-13: 978-1587672231","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235dc75004ae9c0969fb87089ec7b5727e31ee1d","amp;dn":"Johnny+Halloween+Tales+of+the+Dark+Season%28epub%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235dc75004ae9c0969fb87089ec7b5727e31ee1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,93,199,80,4,174,156,9,105,251,135,8,158,199,181,114,126,49,238,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
