A magical voyage through time and space, exploring the history, culture and religions that link East and West: from the Persian Empire of Alexander the Great to the huge Mongolian Empire of Kublai Khan, the destinies of highly developed civilizations intermingled until they converged to take the shape of a Eurasian civilization shared by all of us. Babylon, Persepolis, Ai-Khanoum, Baghdad, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦are virtually recreated with incomparable realism by computer generated images.\n\n\n            &lt;------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n                   \n\n\nAncient Chinese documents dating back 1600 years have revealed the presence of Romans at the very heart of China as far back as the year 166 AD. According to these chronicles, they had been emissaries sent by the powers in Rome in order to establish relations with the Han Empire. Were they ambassadors or just ordinary merchants ? Maybe they were bothÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n At the times of Augustus, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first emperor, the empire had been enjoying two prosperous centuries. It was the era of the Pax Romana and RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power was to expand rapidly due to contacts and trade. Endless caravans supplied a steady stream of goods from the Orient to the ports of the Mediterranean. Each trip represented a perilous voyage of 11 000 km with dangers lurking along the trade routes, not least of them being the Huns who turned travelling into a dangerous and uncertain enterprise.\n\nSetting out from Antioch (Antakya), the merchants sent their goods to Asia via the terrestrial trade routes to Lo Yang, the capital of China. Along the road, intermediaries forced themselves upon the Roman and Chinese traders: the Parths, an Iranian tribe which occupied Persia. Their hold on the caravan routes was to become so powerful that the Romans looked for alternatives: it would be the maritime route.\n\nDuring the reign of Augustus, some 120 ships crossed the Indian Ocean. On behalf of the Romans, Tamil sailors expanded their maritime routes towards the golden land, in other words Indochina, then crossed the Malacca straits to reach China. The Romans had established trading posts all along the coast of Indochina and put Tamil or Indian agents in charge of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Episodes will be uploaded as followed:\n------------------------------------------\n\n1)Alexander The Great Conquers The World\n2)Quest For The Forgotten Alexandria\n3)Ghandhara The Renaissance Of Buddhism\n4)The Romans In China\n5)The Silk Road Unites East And West\n6)Baghdad In The Year 1000\n7)Jerusalem 1227 The Excommunicated Peace\n8)The Mongol Conqueror Kublai KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The Romans In China\nYear:  2004\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:48:30\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1970 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 184 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (Multisub Scandinavian) Track 1: Danish \n                                   Track 2: Swedish \n                                   Track 3: Norwegian\n                                   Track 4: Finnish\n \n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External Subtitles Included -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MultiSub Scandianavian  \n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                              IMPORTANT: READ ME\n                             --------------------\n\nSTEP 1.\n-------\n\nTo be alble to view the subtitles you need to associate the ---&gt;&gt; &quot;Idx file&quot; and Sub file with a viewer program such as DAMN_NFO_Viewer_...  If you dont have it already download it. It is a free software program that allows you to view the subtitles.\n\nInstall it and run it.It will say something like that&quot; Lets see if it runs&quot; when you are done with the installation. Now go to the (nfo, idx,srt or sub) file and open it. Windows will now prompt you and ask if you want to search on the internet to find witch program fits or is working for the the choosed file &quot;srt nfo or sub&quot;. Choose the second option that says i will search program for my own. When done choosing, a list of all so far association programs will come up. Find DAMN_NFO Viewer and click on it.\n\nThe file is now associated with DAMN_NFO Viewer and you will not need to do thoose steps again. That goes for all srt,nfo,sub,idx files. You will have to associate them all four.It is a one time work that gives you the ability to have subtitles on all your movies and be able to open the nfo files.\n\n                        &lt;-----------------------&gt;\n\n**** Another thing thats not to be forgotten is that you have to make sure that your &quot;avi&quot; file=movie..documentary or whatever has the same name as your &quot;srt&quot; file=subtitle.\nEx: Of Men And Penguins.avi =MOVIE.............-------&gt; Of Men And Penguins.srt =Subtitle.****\nNow you are done, have fun watching your movies with subtitles....By default all my documentaries are renamed and adjusted so you dont have to do anything.\n\n\n\nSTEP 2.\n-------\n\nDownload VLC player if you dont have it, also a free software that can be found here ---&gt;&gt;&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.&lt;/a&gt;    \n\nIt plays almost everything..\nWhen you are done installing it choose the movie/documentary.
