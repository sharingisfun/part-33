Decent shooting for the most part but it's just a bit shaky on closeups (although some closeups are excellent) and the filmer misses the focus a bit here and there. Picture quality is hazy and lacking in detail and color. This could stand to &quot;lose a few gens&quot;. Audio is muffled but the vocals all come through nicely.\n\n\nSetlist:\nPsycho circus\nShout it out loud\nDeuce\nDo you love me?\nFirehouse\nShock me\nLet me go, rock 'n' roll\nCalling Dr. Love\nInto the void\nAce's solo\nKing of the night time world\nGod of thunder\nWithin\nPeter's solo\nI was made for lovin' you\nLove gun\n100,000 years\nRock and roll all nite\nBeth\nDetroit rock city\nBlack diamond","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f25f6914688ee12118d544c5927471e434212e","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Paris%2CFrance+22-3-1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f25f6914688ee12118d544c5927471e434212e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,242,95,105,20,104,142,225,33,24,213,68,197,146,116,113,228,52,33,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
