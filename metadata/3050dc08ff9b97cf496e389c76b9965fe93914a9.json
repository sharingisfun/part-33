You will learn how to create pivot, point and hinged constraints within nCloth. Set driven keys will be used to help move the cloth to get the results we are after. Finally I will be showing you how to deal with stretching in your ridged mechanical parts. All this will give a simulated rig that will interact with your environment at a frame rate that will allow for close to real time interaction.The second project will give another example on how to go about setting up a semi mechanical simulated rig. You can expect to learn many of the exotic issues a rig like this will bring, but more importantly how to work your way around them.\n01. Introduction and project overview 00:58\n02.
