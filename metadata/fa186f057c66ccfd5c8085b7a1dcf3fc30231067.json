He declined to disclose the amount but said it was seven figures.\n\nSavage has been given ownership of his show, according to Horowitz, which means he will be off the air until he signs a contract with a new syndicator.\n\nÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Within an hour of knowing he was free, we were already talking to top names in the business,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ Horowitz said.\n\nWND contacted TRN, but a staffer said no one in a position to comment was available.\n\nGet SavageÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s free weekly insider newsletter five days a week in your email inbox by going to the top of the home page on SavageÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s website and clicking the green ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£SUBSCRIBEÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ box.\n\nAs WND reported, the new Talk Stream Live ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Power 50,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ which ranks the top talk-radio shows streaming on the Web, had Savage in the No. 2 spot.\n\nTalk Stream Live says it sampled more than 1.2 million listeners during the first six months of the year to produce ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£The Power 50 ReportÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ the 50 most influential talk show hosts on the Internet and on mobile devices.\n\nÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£We are proud to report that Rush Limbaugh is No. 1 and Michael Savage is No. 2,ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ said TSL.
