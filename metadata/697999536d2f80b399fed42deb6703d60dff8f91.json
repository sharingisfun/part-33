For computational statistics, R has an advantage over other languages in providing readily-available data extraction and transformation packages, making it easier to carry out your ETL tasks. Along with this, its data visualization packages help users get a better understanding of the underlying data distributions while its range of &quot;standard&quot; statistical packages simplify analysis of the data.\r\n\r\nThis book will teach you how powerful business cases are solved by applying machine learning techniques on social media data. You will learn about important and recent developments in the field of social media, along with a few advanced topics such as Open Authorization (OAuth). Through practical examples, you will access data from R using APIs of various social media sites such as Twitter,Instagram, GitHub, Foursquare, LinkedIn, Blogger, and other networks. We will provide you with detailed explanations on the implementation of various use cases using R programming.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tBook Details\r\n\r\nTitle: Mastering Social Media Mining with R - Ascetic_trip [CPUL]\r\nBy:\tSharan Kumar Ravindran, Vikram Garg\r\nISBN:\t978-1-78439-631-2\r\nYear:\t2015\r\nPages:\t248\r\nLanguage:\tEnglish\r\nFile size:\t12.5 MB\r\nFile format:\tPDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:697999536d2f80b399fed42deb6703d60dff8f91","amp;dn":"Mastering+Social+Media+Mining+with+R+-+Ascetic_trip+%5BCPUL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"697999536d2f80b399fed42deb6703d60dff8f91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,121,153,83,109,47,128,179,153,254,212,45,235,103,3,214,13,255,143,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
