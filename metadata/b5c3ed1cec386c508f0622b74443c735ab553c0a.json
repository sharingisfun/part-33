Jeremy will travel the globe and risk life and limb on his journey to uncover the truth about the dark secrets of our planet's rivers.\nThis 7-part series features mysterious predators with the potential to kill include the Giant Snakehead, Goliath Tigerfish, Stingray, Congo Catfish, Nile Perch, Sturgeon and the Zambezi Shark.\n\n\n1)  Demon Fish \nJeremy Wade journeys to the infamous Congo River in Central Africa in search of the Goliath Tiger Fish--quite possibly the world's most ferocious river fish. This supernatural monster predator pushes Jeremy to his physical and mental limit. It requires all of his skills and the help of a local witch doctor to catch one.\n\n2)  Death Ray \nJeremy Wade heads to The Mekong River in Thailand in search of one of the worlds largest and most terrifying river fish--the Giant Freshwater Stingray. Armed with a venomous ten-inch barb on the end of its whip like tail, this mysterious 700-pound River Monster is in a class of its own--and does not give up its secrets to Wade without a fight.\n\n3)  Killer Snakehead \nAngler Jeremy Wade sets his sights on an aggressive Far Eastern predator that's now invading America's backyards. Accused of homicide, and said to breathe air and crawl on land, the Snakehead is a monster that sounds more like a gangster than a fish. Does its bite match the hype?\n\n4)  Congo Killer \nJeremy Wade travels to one of the few rivers left on earth that will still test a fisherman. The Congo, a river steeped in legends, and soaked in violence. One spirit in particular is said to lure fishermen from their boats to their death. Jeremy discovers that the truth is every bit as frightening as the myth.\n\n5)  Alaskan Horror \nDeep in the Alaskan wilderness, people on two bottomless lakes have been vanishing without trace for thousands of years. Extreme angler, Jeremy Wade, searches for the lethal lake monster of native legend that's dragging them into the icy depths.\n\n6)  Rift Valley Killer \nJeremy Wade is on a quest to Africa's Rift Valley, the cradle of mankind, to explore the roots of fishing and the monsters these first fishermen faced. It's a dangerous place, but at its heart is a worthy prize, Africa's largest fresh water fish - the Nile Perch.\n\n7)**** Hidden Predator **** \nBull sharks are the most aggressive and unpredictable of all the sharks and thought to be responsible for more attacks on people than any other. Last year the biggest bull shark ever recorded was caught in a river in South Africa.\nJeremy Wade travels to this river to see if last year's catch was a one off or if there are more monsters out there, and discover if the presence of this known man-eater is a human tragedy just waiting to happen.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img687.imageshack.us/img687/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/6254/rivermonstersseries2scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c38baaa4ab838ff0edf2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1812 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AC3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AVC 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 49mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: 673 MB\n * Container: MP4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Monsters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=River%20Monsters%3A%20Series%201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=River%20Monsters%3A%20Series%201&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5c3ed1cec386c508f0622b74443c735ab553c0a","amp;dn":"ITV+River+Monsters+Series+2+7of7+Hidden+Predator+DVDrip+x264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5c3ed1cec386c508f0622b74443c735ab553c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,195,237,28,236,56,108,80,143,6,34,183,68,67,199,53,171,85,60,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
