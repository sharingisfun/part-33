It&amp;#039;s been almost two years since their last full-length album Goddamnit, but this Chicago trio has put together another 10 tracks of pop punk. As fans have come to expect of Alkaline Trio, Maybe I&amp;#039;ll Catch Fire is loaded with tormented, antagonistic and alcohol-soaked themes. \n\nWhat sets Alkaline Trio apart from their peers is the emotional drive their songs are infused with. Listening to Alkaline Trio&amp;#039;s music, you feels as if you&amp;#039;re in the backseat on this bad trip to Hell with Matt Skiba (guitar), Dan Adriano (bass), and Glenn Porter (drums). Strangely enough, the experience isn&amp;#039;t loud and obnoxious like most punk bands would have you believe, but rather disturbingly quiet and heavy.\n\nEnjoy! :) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5858d5b05aec798cdbf9dd9e4964ddfd9dce3135","amp;dn":"Alkaline+Trio+-+Maybe+I%5C%27ll+Catch+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5858d5b05aec798cdbf9dd9e4964ddfd9dce3135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,88,213,176,90,236,121,140,219,249,221,158,73,100,221,253,157,206,49,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
