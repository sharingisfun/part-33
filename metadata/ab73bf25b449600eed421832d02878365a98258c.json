While there is no denying the authority he holds when he sings about how God has changed his life, it's time to focus his music. Once Upon A Shattered Life, the band's sophomore effort, is truly a breakout release and one worthy to be heard. There are many assets to this group's music including Rojas' powerful vocal presence, much akin to the likes of Mac Powell (Third Day) or Bart Millard (Mercy Me). Newcomer Ray Fryoux lays down a bed of steady beats and anchors a solid rhythm section with bassist Joshua Schwartz. Meanwhile, Jeremy Holderfield provides riveting guitar work throughout, especially on tracks like &quot;Shattered Life&quot; and &quot;Chris' Letter.&quot; Smooth rockers like &quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;Brand New Man&quot; display a simplicity and catchiness reminiscent of Jeremy Camp or Switchfoot. But while Slumber's modern rock sound may draw parallels, this band makes its own mark on tracks like &quot;Make Believe&quot; and &quot;Back in Time,&quot; showcasing an offset rhythm and creative guitar work. The band can even bring it down as it does on the two softer closing numbers, &quot;Masquerade&quot; and &quot;Oceans from the Rain.&quot; The release is a confident step forward for the band both creatively and (hopefully) commercially and should propel them into the upper echelons of Christian music.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, May 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab73bf25b449600eed421832d02878365a98258c","amp;dn":"Seventh+Day+Slumber+-+2005+-+Once+Upon+A+Shattered+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab73bf25b449600eed421832d02878365a98258c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,115,191,37,180,73,96,14,237,66,24,50,208,40,120,54,90,152,37,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
