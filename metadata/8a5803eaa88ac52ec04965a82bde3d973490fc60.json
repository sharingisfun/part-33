Energy science itself is a broad field that spans many disciplines -- policy, mathematics, physical chemistry, chemical engineering, geology, materials science and mineralogy -- and the author has selected the material, as well as end-of-chapter problems and policy discussions, that provide the necessary tools to interested students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a5803eaa88ac52ec04965a82bde3d973490fc60","amp;dn":"Carbon+Capture+-+Jennifer+Wilcox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a5803eaa88ac52ec04965a82bde3d973490fc60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,88,3,234,168,138,197,46,192,73,101,168,43,222,61,151,52,144,252,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
