The band has released three full-length albums, two EPs and two DVDs depicting their performances at Wacken Open Air (in 2005) and Bloodstock Open Air (in 2010). The group comprises Martin Axenrot (Opeth), Anders NystrÃƒÂ¶m (Katatonia), Jonas Renkse (Katatonia), Nick Holmes (Paradise Lost), and Per Eriksson, who was previously the guitar technician for both Bloodbath and Katatonia.\n\nThe band named themselves after the song &quot;Blood Bath&quot; from the album To the Gory End by Cancer. A year after being formed, the band, then consisting of Mikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt (Opeth) on vocals, Dan SwanÃƒÂ¶ (Edge of Sanity, Nightingale, etc.) on drums, Anders &quot;Blakkheim&quot; NystrÃƒÂ¶m (Katatonia, Diabolical Masquerade) on guitar, and Jonas Renkse (Katatonia, October Tide) on bass, released their EP Breeding Death, followed two years later by their debut album Resurrection Through Carnage.\n\nIn 2004, Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt left Bloodbath to free up more time for his primary band Opeth. To replace him, Bloodbath brought in Peter TÃƒÂ¤gtgren (Hypocrisy). The lineup changed further, with SwanÃƒÂ¶ switching to play the guitar instead of drums. Martin Axenrot (Witchery, Satanic Slaughter, Opeth) took his place and the band was now bigger and more serious, no longer just a secondary project. The band's second full release, Nightmares Made Flesh, was released in Europe in September 2004.\n\nIn February 2005, TÃƒÂ¤gtgren left the band due to &quot;conflicting schedules&quot;. That same year, Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt rejoined the band for a single live show at Germany's Wacken Open Air on August 5. Prior to the show, the band commented on the Wacken show: &quot;Not only the first, but also the last gig for Bloodbath (with Mikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt on vocals)&quot;; later it also turned out to be the last one with SwanÃƒÂ¶. In September 2005, Bloodbath started searching for a new lead singer.\n\nIn August 2006, the band announced the departure of SwanÃƒÂ¶ from their ranks due to musical differences, as well as SwanÃƒÂ¶ being busy with other projects. They simultaneously closed the vocal auditions, announcing that no suitable singer had been found.\n\nOn March 27, 2007, the band announced that a new line-up would shortly be unveiled, along with news that they were producing new material, to be released on a mini-CD towards the end of summer. In August 2007, Renkse wrote a message on the band's official discussion forum which suggested that work was in progress. On January 30, 2008, it was announced via the Bloodbath website that Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt would be rejoining the line-up on vocals, along with new member Per Eriksson (ex-21 Lucifers, ex-Genocrush Ferox) on guitar. In March 2008, the EP Unblessing the Purity was released. Also released in 2008 was the Wacken live CD/DVD The Wacken Carnage. Bloodbath released their third full length album, The Fathomless Mastery, in October 2008.\n\nOn April 25, 2011, Bloodbath released their second DVD, Bloodbath over Bloodstock, which contains their performance at Bloodstock Festival 2010, as well as their 2008 performance at Party San. On November 1, 2011, during the final show of the American Opeth/Katatonia tour at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore, MD, Bloodbath performed a surprise encore after Opeth's set.\n\nOn April 14, 2012, Blakkheim announced that Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt officially left the group.\n\nBlakkheim has said in multiple interviews that they have a new vocalist set, but they cannot reveal the identity at the moment due to the lack of contract. When asked in one interview whether the new vocalist was known or not, Blakkheim said, &quot;Oh, he's a legend!&quot;. On September 16, 2014, the band announced the new Bloodbath vocalist as Nick Holmes from Paradise Lost.\n\nMembers\n\nCurrent members\n\n  Anders &quot;Blakkheim&quot; NystrÃƒÂ¶m Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitars, backing vocals (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n  Jonas Renkse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n  Martin &quot;Axe&quot; Axenrot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n  Per &quot;Sodomizer&quot; Eriksson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n  Nick Holmes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nFormer members\n\n  Mikael Ãƒâ€¦kerfeldt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004, 2005, 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012)\n  Dan SwanÃƒÂ¶ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2004), guitars (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006)\n  Peter TÃƒÂ¤gtgren Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2005)\n\nDiscography\n\nResurrection Through Carnage\n\n  Released: November 12, 2002\n  Label: Century Media Records\n  Formats: CD, digital download\n\n\nNightmares Made Flesh\n\n  Released: September 27, 2004\n  Label: Century Media Records\n  Formats: CD, digital download\n\n\n\nThe Fathomless Mastery\n\n  Released: September 29, 2008\n  Label: Peaceville Records\n  Formats: CD, digital download\n\n\n\nGrand Morbid Funeral\n\n  Released: November 17, 2014\n  Label: Peaceville Records\n  Formats: CD, digital download\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tDeath Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t11.32 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n1 file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05707ec09da652172d22655d6929ab98c7dd7b5","amp;dn":"Bloodbath+-+Famine+of+Gods+Word+%28Single%29+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05707ec09da652172d22655d6929ab98c7dd7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,87,7,236,9,218,101,33,114,210,38,85,214,146,154,185,140,125,215,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
