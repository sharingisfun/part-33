It was the last time these two mega blues stars were to play together before Albert&amp;#039;s retirement and subsequent death and Stevie&amp;#039;s untimely death in a helicopter crash.\n\nThe CD sequence is somewhat messed up, the actual show was quite interesting in that Albert, the reigning &quot;King of the Blues&quot; didn&amp;#039;t realize that he knew Stevie and had played with him several times. He only knew that he was going to jam with the guy who recorded Pride and Joy. As it turns out the two had jammed several times in Texas when Stevie was very young and was considered a prodigy. At the time, he billed himself as &quot;Little Stevie&quot;.  It wasn&amp;#039;t until a few songs into the session that Albert realized that Stevie Ray Vaughan was Little Stevie. It was interesting in that in several interviews prior, Albert had always said that when he retired, Little Stevie would be the next &quot;King of the Blues&quot;. In the 7th selection, he&amp;#039;s passing the mantle.\n\nWhat makes this rare is that the TV station didn&amp;#039;t have much of a distribution network and you pretty much had to go to Canada to get it and Canada isn&amp;#039;t exactly a bastion of the Blues. I&amp;#039;m not sure if it was re-released after their deaths. \n\n\n01 - Call It Stormy Monday.mp3\n02 - Old Times.mp3    (chat)\n03 - Pride And Joy.mp3\n04 - Ask Me No Questions.mp3\n05 - Pep Talk.mp3    (chat)\n06 - Blues At Sunrise.mp3\n07 - Turn It Over.mp3    (chat)\n08 - Overall Junction.mp3\n09 - Match Box Blues.mp3\n10 - Who Is Stevie.mp3    (chat)\n11 - Don&amp;#039;t Lie To Me.mp3\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE RESEED !!! I&amp;#039;ll keep passing along CD&amp;#039;s depending on my bandwidth, your reseeding helps me and everyone. Thanks in advance. Every little bit helps...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2e17388a43e3af1b831d2ac9f55a81281da5880","amp;dn":"Albert+King+%26+Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+-+In+Session+1983+%40VBRH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2e17388a43e3af1b831d2ac9f55a81281da5880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,225,115,136,164,62,58,241,184,49,210,172,159,85,168,18,129,218,88,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
