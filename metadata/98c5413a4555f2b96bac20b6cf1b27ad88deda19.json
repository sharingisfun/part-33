In November 2008 bassist Marios M. joined the band. After few days the band played live at An Club. Initially, the music style of the band was Death/Grind and then released a promo called &quot;Eat Your Brains&quot; via Deathforce Records which was recorded on September, 2008 without a bassist. Few months later, Marios M. left the band and about a year later George joined. NECROPHOBIC REVULSION changed the sound to old school Death Metal and finally in October 2011 released the first full-length album called &quot;Brigades Of Subjugation&quot;, recorded and mixed at M.I.H. Studio in Kallithea, Athens by David Prudent. NECROPHOBIC REVULSION continues playing live in Greece and gets prepared to spread the music everywhere.\n\nInfluences: DEATH (early),OBITUARY, MORBID ANGEL (early)\n\nReleases\n\n&quot;Necrophobic Cumshot&quot; (demo) - 2008  \n&quot;Eat Your Brains&quot; (demo) - 2008  \n&quot;Brigades Of Subjugation&quot; (full length) - 2011\n\n\nBrigades Of Subjugation tracklist :\n1.\t Anger and Hate\n2.\t Buried Nations\n3.\t Brigades of Subjugation\n4.\t Bloodsucking Carcass\n5.\t Dominant Disaffection\n6.\t Congenial Dissipation\n7.\t Necrophobic Revulsion\n8.\t Slaughter the Leaders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c5413a4555f2b96bac20b6cf1b27ad88deda19","amp;dn":"Necrophobic+Revulsion+-+Brigades+Of+Subjugation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98c5413a4555f2b96bac20b6cf1b27ad88deda19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,197,65,58,69,85,242,185,107,172,32,182,207,27,39,173,136,222,218,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
