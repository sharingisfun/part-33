It identifies by-products produced from the ZVI-mediated degradation process of particular contaminants, and clarifies  the reaction mechanism by which ZVI degrades a chosen contaminant. It also assesses how the ZVI-based technology may be applied in complex, natural systems, the limitations to implementation, and possible avenues for further research which might improve the viability of the process","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425faccc95f4b6f4310789220be0568cf320def3","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+for+Environmental+Remediation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425faccc95f4b6f4310789220be0568cf320def3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,95,172,204,149,244,182,244,49,7,137,34,11,224,86,140,243,32,222,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
