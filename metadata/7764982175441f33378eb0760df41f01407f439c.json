Before a particularly dangerous new stunt, Johnny meets his childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Raquel Alessi/Eva Mendes), now a journalist, and makes a dinner date with her that evening. During the same time, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), Mephistopheles' son, comes to Earth to find the lost contract and use its power to overturn his father. To ensure himself allies, he enlists the fallen angels known as the Hidden, a trio of demon spirits who represent three of the four elements ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the water-demon Wallow (Daniel Frederiksen), the earth-demon Gressil (Laurence Breuls), and the air-demon Abigor (Mathew Wilkinson). In response, Mephistopheles makes Johnny the new Ghost Rider, and offers Johnny his soul in return for defeating Blackheart. His powers as Ghost Rider revealed, Johnny is spirited off by his bike at high speed to a railroad station built in place of the graveyard where the contract was once buried. Johnny discovers Blackheart and his minions at the station and, assuming his Ghost Rider form, Johnny kills Gressil while the others escape. On his way out of the station he uses his Penance Stare (a technique in which all the violence a person has committed is suddenly turned against them) on a mugger, leaving the man catatonic; the mugger's victim gets away.\n\nGenre: Action | Fantasy | Thriller\n\nRelease date: 2 March 2007 (UK)\n\ncast\n\nNicolas Cage\nEva Mendes\nWes Bentley\nSam Elliott\nDonal Logue\nPeter Fonda\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name:Ghost Rider 720p BRRip\nFormat:Matroska\nFile size:2095.30 MiB\nDuration:2h 3mn\nOverall bit rate:2 374 Kbps\nSubtitles:Arabic,English,French,Vietnames,Swedish\nEncoded Date:UTC 2011-06-17 06:07:23\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type:x264 - core 115 r1995 c1e60b9\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type:2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x544\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language:English\nAudio Codec:AAC\nBitrate:%Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count:6 channels\nSample Rate:48.0 KHz\n\nGREETZ: To all my fellow HDScene Encoders, DarkScene, blackjesus and all other Releasers we respect....You know who you are.\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/33291540462025353758.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/33291540462025353758.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/06566058520164588797.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/06566058520164588797.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44939448881898668702.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44939448881898668702.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/95716796040413420771.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/95716796040413420771.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54715434635107086470.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/54715434635107086470.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44025881100070025341.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/44025881100070025341.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7764982175441f33378eb0760df41f01407f439c","amp;dn":"Ghost+Rider+Extended+720p+BRRip+Multi-Sub+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7764982175441f33378eb0760df41f01407f439c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,100,152,33,117,68,31,51,55,142,176,118,13,244,31,1,64,127,67,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
