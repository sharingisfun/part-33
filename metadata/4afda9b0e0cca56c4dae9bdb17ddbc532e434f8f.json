He's never had a birthday party, or gone to a friend's house for an overnight. In fact, Luke has never had a friend.\n\nLuke is one of the shadow children, a third child forbidden by the Population Police. He's lived his entire life in hiding and now, with a new housing development replacing the woods next to his family's farm, he is no longer even allowed to go outside.\n\nThen, one day Luke sees a girl's face in the window of a house where he knows two other children already live. Finally, he's met a shadow child like himself.\n\nJen is willing to risk everything to come out of the shadows -- does Luke dare to become involved in her dangerous plan ? Can he afford not to ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4afda9b0e0cca56c4dae9bdb17ddbc532e434f8f","amp;dn":"Among+the+Hidden+%28Shadow+Children+%231%29+-+Margaret+Peterson+Haddix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4afda9b0e0cca56c4dae9bdb17ddbc532e434f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,253,169,176,224,204,165,108,77,174,155,219,23,221,188,83,46,67,79,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
