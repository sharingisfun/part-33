They have only 1 choice - to join the Federation, which will mean an end to 70 years of wars. Admiral James T. Kirk and crew are called upon to help in the negotiations because of their &quot;experience&quot; of the Klingon race. Peace talks don&amp;#039;t quite go to plan, and eventually Kirk and McCoy are tried and convicted of assassination, and sent to Rura Penthe, a snowy hard-labour prison camp. Will they manage to escape ? And will there ever be peace with the Klingons ?\n\nCAST\n\n\n\tWilliam Shatner\t... \tCaptain James T.
