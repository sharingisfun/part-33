The name comes from a lyric in the song &quot;Shadows On Your Side&quot; from the Seven and the Ragged Tiger album.\n\nAs The Lights Go Down is essentially the Arena video without the theatrical sequences, although the live footage for many songs was edited differently. This version was first aired on the Cinemax cable television channel, and later on MTV and other music channels. The concert was also shown on British television channel ITV, on 30 December 1984 at 1700 hours. At least two versions exist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0953d1a5180b680c14fd8da9e82ce9070e9823","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-+As+The+Lights+Go+Down","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0953d1a5180b680c14fd8da9e82ce9070e9823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,9,83,209,165,24,11,104,12,20,253,141,169,232,44,233,7,14,152,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
