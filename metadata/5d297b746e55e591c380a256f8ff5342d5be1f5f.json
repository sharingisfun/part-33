They even reused some of the scenes from the 1934 version, no big deal. Much better IMO, I like Bing's crooning....:^)\n\nThe horse's name is &quot;Highland Dale&quot;, he's more well known as &quot;Fury&quot; in the 1950's Western of the same name. Also played a bit role in Oklahoma.\n\nThis is also one of three movies that Oliver Hardy acted in without his partner Stan Laurel during the 25 year period they made comedies together.
