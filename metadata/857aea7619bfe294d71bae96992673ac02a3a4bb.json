I grew up with the 1970\n\nBOULEZ on vinyl (double LP) with the Deryck Cooke 10th included on the\n\nextra disc.  Heavy stuff for a teenager.  It's a joy to hear this awesome\n\n&quot;cantata&quot; without all the worn LP &quot;special effects.&quot;\n\n\nFor those of you either new to, or curious about Mahler this is a good work\n\nto initiate yourself with.  Mahler creates nearly unbearable tension with\n\ndissonance but this is accessible music, firmly rooted in Romanticism.\n\n\nThis is not my rip....I extracted it from  COMPLETE WORKS files so that others\n\ncan access it without occupying 5GB on disc.\n\n\nThe &quot;program&quot; involves brothers, murder, and a queen with some issues.\n\nMahler wrote this as A TEENAGER! .........
