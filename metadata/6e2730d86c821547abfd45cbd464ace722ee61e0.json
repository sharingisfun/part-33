Full Descriptioncomposer, and arranger that is highly influential and distinctive.  Possessed of a light, almost classical touch, and a purveyor of negative space and minimal phrasing (his influence on Davis can certainly be seen here), Jamal worked largely in trio settings, and used his conceptions of space and subtlety to create dynamic tensions within the group. At the same time, the artist's work is rooted firmly in the blues and swings intently, without fail.\n\nAHMAD'S BLUES, the CD reissue of the trio's 1958 live date in Washington D.C., demonstrates all of these qualities in spades.  Supremely attentive playing by bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Vernel Fournier (his brush work on the intricate, gear-shifting &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; is especially noteworthy) provide groundwork, foil, and shifting frames for Jamal's virtuoso explorations. The ensemble's work brings new ideas -- the musicians often incorporate understated mambo, fractured swing rhythms, or airy, abstract structures -- to standards ( &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy;&quot; &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; ) and to Jamal's own compositions ( the delicate &quot;Seleritus&quot; ).  AHMAD'S BLUES allows us to eavesdrop on the sophisticated, innovative artist and company at work.&quot;\n\nThis CD reissues most of the music recorded on one night by the 1958 Ahmad Jamal Trio (which consisted of the pianist/leader, bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Vernel Fournier) during a live performance in Washington D.C.  Originally released as the LP Ahmad Jamal plus part of Portfolio of Ahmad Jamal, these 16 selections display the uniqueness and tightness of this memorable unit.  With great attention paid to dynamics and the use of space yet always swinging (at least lightly), the Ahmad Jamal Trio is heard at its best on such numbers as &quot;It Could Happen to You,&quot; &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy,&quot; &quot;Squatly Roo,&quot; &quot;A Gal in Calico&quot; and &quot;Let's Fall in Love.&quot; ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nAhmad Jamal (Piano)\nIsrael Crosby (Double Bass)\nVernel Fournier (Drums)\n\nAhmad Jamal Trio - Ahmad's Blues Tracks:\n01  Ahmad's Blues (Ahmad Jamal) 4:06 \n02  It Could Happen To You (Johnny Burke/Jimmy Van Heusen) 4:15\n03  I Wish I Knew (Mack Gordon/Harry Warren) 3:45 \n04  Autumn Leaves (Jacques Prevert/Johnny Mercer/Joseph Kosma) 7:40 \n05  Stompin' At The Savoy (Benny Goodman/Chick Webb/Edgar Sampson) 4:15 \n06  Cheek To Cheek (Irving Berlin) 4:47 \n07  The Girl Next Door (Ralph Blane/Hugh Martin) 3:26 \n08  Secret Love (Paul Francis Webster/Sammy Fain) 3:51 \n09  Squatty Roo (Johnny Hodges) 2:18 \n10  Taboo (S.K.
