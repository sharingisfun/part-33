(They fornicated with Human Women)\n\n3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\n\n4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. (The Giants, includes Goliath)\n\n5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.\n\n6 And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.\n\n7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.\n\n8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.\n\n9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. (NO NEPHILIM BLOOD)\n\n10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\n11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n\n12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.\n\n13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.\n\n14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\n\n15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.\n\n16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.\n\n17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.\n\n18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.\n\n19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.\n\n20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\n\n21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.\n\n22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.\n\nThe Nephilim are already here.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d973c8f5668c63b2a85585675e3f95689fa09e3","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Fallen+Angels+-+Nephilim+-+Giants+and+Demons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d973c8f5668c63b2a85585675e3f95689fa09e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,151,60,143,86,104,198,59,42,133,88,86,117,227,249,86,137,250,9,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
