In 1947, Visconti went to Sicily, with a small amount of capital advanced by the Communist Party, to make what was initially to have been a short documentary. He stayed there for six months, and the project gradually expanded in scale until what was proposed became a mammoth epic on the conditions of the poor workers and peasants and their struggle to liberate themselves from oppression.\n\n\n*This is an MKV Rip of Apokarteron's DVD Rip found here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4908224/La_terra_trema_-_Luchino_Visconti\n\nI wanted to provide a smaller file, since the other ~800mb file is crap. Excellent quality. Soft-subbed English. Thanks for seeding.
