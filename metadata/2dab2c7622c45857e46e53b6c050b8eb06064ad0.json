ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as hypnotic as it is crushing; the band is as much about taking you on a journey to the center of the mind as they are about pulverizing said mind into space dust. But for as glacial and methodical as the music is, it is also impressively dynamic, Church never gets stuck on any one part for too long, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re seemingly always looking to push their colossal songs onward to total oblivion.\n\nUnanswered Hymns is currently available digitally from OaklandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Transylvanian Tapes, with a physical release soon to follow. You can also catch the band live here in Sacramento at their upcoming gig w/ 16, Brainoil and Kowloon Walled City at Starlite Lounge on 4/25; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also set to tour the Pacific Northwest in June, including a kickoff show w/ Ufomammut + another set of dates in August w/ Primitive Man and Northless.
