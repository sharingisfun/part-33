Joseph is eleven. And this June morning, he must go to school, a yellow star sewn on his chest. He receives the support of a goods dealer. The mockery of a baker. Between kindness and contempt, Jo, his Jewish friends, their families, learn of life in an occupied Paris, on the Butte Montmartre, where they've taken shelter. At least that's what they think, until that morning on July 16th 1942, when their fragile happiness is toppled over. From the VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lodrome D'Hiver, where 13 000 Jews are crammed, to the camp of Beaune-La-Rolande, from Vichy to the terrace of the Berghof, La Rafle follows the real destinies of the victims and the executioners. Of those who orchestrated it all. Of those who trusted them. Of those who fled. Of those who opposed them. Every character in this film has existed. Every event, even the most extreme, transpired on that summer of 1942.\n\nFile Name .........................................: La Rafle.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,346,018,816 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:05:11\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x304 (AR: 2.368)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2045 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.390 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1382725/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1382725/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrench audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nRose Bosch - La rafle.
