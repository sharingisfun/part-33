This is a good practice; doing so keeps Active\n\tDirectory secure and clean. For example, someone can create a user \n\taccount, leave it untouched for many days, and then use it to \n\tperform malicious activity against an organization. \n\n\tAnother example is employee retirement: User accounts must be disabled\n\twhen an employee quits an organization, but in practice, IT departments\n\tare usually the last to know when somebody leaves. Also, most HR databases\n\tonly keep information about the &quot;primary&quot; user account and know nothing\n\tabout additional user accounts.\n\n\tInactive Users Tracker automates the management of inactive user accounts.\n\tThe program periodically checks all user accounts in specified domains and\n\treports all accounts inactive for more than specified number of days.\n\nProduct features:\n\n    \t- Checks all users and reports those that have been inactive for a \n\t  specified number of days.\n    \t- Automatically deactivates inactive user accounts, either by disabling or\n\t  setting a random password, or finally deleting such accounts (*).\n    \t- Sends notifications to managers about their inactive direct reports.\n    \t- Reports can be sent to IT auditors to ensure regulatory compliance \n\t  (SOX, HIPAA, FISMA, etc). \n\n\n\tTo detect inactivity, the tool checks the &quot;lastLogon&quot; attribute of every\n\tuser account, which represents the last time a user was authenticated by\n\ta specific DC.\n\tAD doesn't replicate this attribute; as a result, the lastLogon value\n\twill be different on each DC. Inactive Users Tracker handles this \n\tcorrectly: It queries all DCs in the domain and uses the most recent \n\tlogon time, also called the &quot;true last logon&quot;.\n\t\n\n\nFor More info about Netwrix Inactive Users Tracker Visit:\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.netwrix.com/products.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.netwrix.com/products.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\n\n\t- Install iutfull_setup.msi \n\t- Replace Iut.exe\n\t- Run .\\Crack\\Patch.reg\n\t- IUT is now fully registered.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8609b253e07bb1de1b809a63dcf773d0c868ed","amp;dn":"Netwrix+Inactive+Users+Tracker+2.0.22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8609b253e07bb1de1b809a63dcf773d0c868ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,134,9,178,83,224,123,177,222,27,128,154,99,220,247,115,208,200,104,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
