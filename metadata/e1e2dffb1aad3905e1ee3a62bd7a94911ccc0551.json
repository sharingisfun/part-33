Resolutely single, Ambrose delights in Philip as his heir, a man who will love his grand home as much as he does himself. But the cosy world the two construct is shattered when Ambrose sets off on a trip to Florence. There he falls in love and marries - and there he dies suddenly. Jealous of his marriage, racked by suspicion at the hints in Ambrose's letters, and grief-stricken by his death, Philip prepares to meet his cousin's widow with hatred in his heart. Despite himself, Philip is drawn to this beautiful, sophisticated, mysterious Rachel like a moth to the flame. And yet . . . might she have had a hand in Ambrose's death?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e2dffb1aad3905e1ee3a62bd7a94911ccc0551","amp;dn":"Daphne+du+Maurier+-+My+Cousin+Rachel+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e2dffb1aad3905e1ee3a62bd7a94911ccc0551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,226,223,251,26,173,57,5,225,238,58,98,189,122,148,145,28,204,5,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
