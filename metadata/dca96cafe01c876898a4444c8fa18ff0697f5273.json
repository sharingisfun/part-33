High Road And End Title \n\nMagazine Soundtrack Review\n\nOver the decades composer John Barry has established himself as the King of the Super-Romantic Theme. Finally released after almost two decades have passed, High Road to China supplies ample evidence as to why. \n\nHigh Road to China provides many moments of emotion that can be found in a dozen or more of his other scores. The beauty of Out of Africa, the freedom of Dances with Wolves and the danger of Raise the Titanic are but a few of them. This 1983 score provides the listener with the trademark, attractive main theme and is repeated many, many times throughout the film and score- another Barry trademark.\n\nCollectors who have clamored for this score or for Barry fans who want more of the same consistent work of his, High Road to China will surely satisfy. The recording is not the crispest one will hear, but given the age of the masters, the producers have done an adequate job.\n\nFrom the Liner Notes\n\n&quot;For HIGH ROAD TO CHINA, John Barry has composed a musical score which combines the excitement and romance of the film with the nostalgic mood of the music of the Twenties. The musical spectrum covers a potpourri of the gnere referred to now as &quot;sounds&quot; and is truly a musical adventure which enhances the spirit of the picture. \n\nTom Selleck\n=======================================================================================\nThe best video/audio players to play movies are: \n\nFree DivX Player Windows: http://www.divx.com/divx/windows/ \nMac: http://www.divx.com/divx/mac/?cid=DP0000279 \n\nVLC (VideoLan)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThe KM Player  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094&lt;/a&gt; \n======================================================================================== \nPlease be patient &amp; continue to share after your download completes. \nThe more who share, the faster everyone can get the file. \n\nTo all who post comments below: Thank you &amp; we appreciate your feedback. \n\nEnjoy! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca96cafe01c876898a4444c8fa18ff0697f5273","amp;dn":"High+Road+To+China%5BAudio%5D%5B1983-Soundtrack%5D%5BA+LordOfWar+Release%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca96cafe01c876898a4444c8fa18ff0697f5273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,169,108,175,224,28,135,104,152,164,68,76,143,161,143,240,105,127,82,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
