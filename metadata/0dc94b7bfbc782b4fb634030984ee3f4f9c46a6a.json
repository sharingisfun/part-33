The dispute arises because of what Francis Bacon calls in his Novum Organum the Ã¢â‚¬Å“dullness, incompetence, and deceptions of our human senses.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When we observe outer space, our human senses lead us to two different conclusions:\nOn the one hand, if we judge by appearance, space appears and feels to us like an empty void, leading some to conclude the earth and heavenly bodies are spinning in an empty vacuum. On the other hand, if we judge by behavior, space exhibits physical behaviors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example, it carries light and heat from the sun and stars Ã¢â‚¬â€œ leading some to conclude space is some sort of invisible substance called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the ether.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc94b7bfbc782b4fb634030984ee3f4f9c46a6a","amp;dn":"The+Ether+Dispute%3A+Re-Visiting+Einsteins+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc94b7bfbc782b4fb634030984ee3f4f9c46a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,201,75,123,251,199,130,180,251,99,64,48,152,78,227,244,249,196,106,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
