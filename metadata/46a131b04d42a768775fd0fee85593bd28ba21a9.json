Fronted by singer/guitarist Ladd Mitchell, the group's skillfully crafted and dramatically executed music falls midway between Thursday's thrust and Incubus' hardened melodies. Songs like &quot;Gasoline Kisses for Everyone,&quot; and &quot;Day One and Counting&quot; are cathartic and innovative, as Mitchell and guitarist Justin Valenti build a roar that shimmers as often as it splinters. On &quot;Which Wrist First,&quot; glistening, Chameleons-like guitar lines fuse with the jagged urgency of vintage At the Drive In, and despite it's title, &quot;This Would Be Easier if You Would Just Die&quot; is very much alive on the strength of Mitchell's powerful shout-singing. Tender moments like &quot;Conversations With Emily&quot; are rare but just as captivating, affirming that Park also possesses a depth that could catapult them to next-big-thing status.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46a131b04d42a768775fd0fee85593bd28ba21a9","amp;dn":"Park+-+It+Won%27t+Snow+Where+You%27re+Going+%282003%29+%5BMP3+V0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46a131b04d42a768775fd0fee85593bd28ba21a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,161,49,176,77,66,167,104,119,95,208,254,232,85,147,189,40,186,33,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
