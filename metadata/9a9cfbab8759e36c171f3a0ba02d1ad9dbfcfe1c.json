It's a weary, drug-laden album -- well over half the songs explicitly mention drug use, while the others merely allude to it -- that never fades away, but it barely keeps afloat. Apart from the classic opener, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (a gleeful tune about slavery, interracial sex, and lost virginity, not necessarily in that order), the long workout &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; and the mean-spirited &quot;Bitch,&quot; Sticky Fingers is a slow, bluesy affair, with a few country touches thrown in for good measure. The laid-back tone of the album gives ample room for new lead guitarist Mick Taylor to stretch out, particularly on the extended coda of &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking.&quot; But the key to the album isn't the instrumental interplay -- although that is terrific -- it's the utter weariness of the songs. &quot;Wild Horses&quot; is their first non-ironic stab at a country song, and it is a beautiful, heart-tugging masterpiece. Similarly, &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; is a ravished, late-night classic that ranks among their very best blues. &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; is a horrifying overdose tale, and &quot;Moonlight Mile,&quot; with Paul Buckmaster's grandiose strings, is a perfect closure: sad, yearning, drug-addled, and beautiful. With its offhand mixture of decadence, roots music, and outright malevolence, Sticky Fingers set the tone for the rest of the decade for the Stones. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a9cfbab8759e36c171f3a0ba02d1ad9dbfcfe1c","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones%2C+The+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Sticky+Fingers+vinyl+24%2F96+ow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a9cfbab8759e36c171f3a0ba02d1ad9dbfcfe1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,156,251,171,135,89,227,108,23,31,58,11,160,45,26,217,219,252,254,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
