It features four unique 121 band filters, one for each 256 \nharmonics additive oscillator. It also has sophisticated cross-modulation possibilities \nwhich are good for FM and similar synthesis methods.\n\nMoreover it has an enormous range of processing and modulation options including a \npretty unique arpeggiator, as well as a versatile effects section. Spectral comes with a \nselection of high quality presets in a wide range of styles, an easy-to-use interface, \nand of course this manual.\n\nfuture-dada  MMXIV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea52043d36f08126cbf5d68a8ef47acad6122ba7","amp;dn":"LinPlug+-+Spectral+v1.0.1+-+OS+X+%5Bpacket-dada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea52043d36f08126cbf5d68a8ef47acad6122ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,82,4,61,54,240,129,38,203,245,214,138,142,244,122,202,214,18,43,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
