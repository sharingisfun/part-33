Their best friends Peter (Hayes MacArthur), an attorney, and Alison (Christina Hendricks) set them up on a blind date that goes horribly, and results in both hating each other. As the years go by, Peter and Alison get married, and have a baby girl named Sophie Christina Novak, and select Holly and Eric as godparents of Sophie, but they still don't get along and only put up with each other for their god daughter's sake.\n\nAfter Sophie's first birthday, Peter and Alison die in a car crash. Holly and Messer learn that in their friends wills, they both were named Sophie's joint guardians. Holly and Messer must put their differences aside and move into Sophie's home to care for her. However, living together proves to be a struggle. One night, Holly leaves Sophie with Messer while she covers an important catering job - the same night that he is given the opportunity to direct a big basketball game. Messer takes Sophie to the game, but she constantly distracts him with her crying. When they get home, Messer and Holly argue, but later they make up.\n\nHolly meets Sam (Josh Lucas), Sophie's pediatrician, and finds herself attracted to him. They arrange a date, which is cut short when Messer calls to tell Sam that Sophie has a high fever. Sam and Holly go to the hospital, and Messer sees Holly kiss Sam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cebc157d3b588b78da3869df7c348b5466584e4","amp;dn":"Life+as+We+Know+It+%282010%29+HD2DVD+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cebc157d3b588b78da3869df7c348b5466584e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,235,193,87,211,181,136,183,141,163,134,157,247,195,72,181,70,101,132,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
