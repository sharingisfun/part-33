Working as a solo artist, in a long-time partnership with guitarist Buddy Guy and also backing other Blues greats like Muddy Waters, Wells showed the world that there was no one that he wouldn't try to meet or beat on the Blues harp.\nThis CD is one of Junior's later releases, but it certainly isn't one of the least. Backed by long-time partner Buddy Guy as well as many of Chicago's best Blues players, Wells puts out a top-notch effort on this one. There is plenty of great music to go around, including his signature piece 'Messin' With The Kid'. The overall effort is typical Junior Wells; straight-forward Rockin' Chicago Blues. A definite must-have for any Chicago Blues Harmonica enthusiast. \n(Peter Krampert at amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nJunior Wells - Better Off With The Blues\n(Telarc 1993)\n\n 1. Cry For Me Baby  \n 2.
