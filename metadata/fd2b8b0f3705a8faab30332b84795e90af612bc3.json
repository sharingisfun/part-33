Before he knows it, he is in the hands of the Turkish Secret Police. In exchange for the police not looking too closely into Arthur's background, he agrees (reluctantly) to work for them while also working for a gang planning to rob the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.\n\nThe reader David Westhead makes the character of Arthur come alive, in a way that too few other readers do. Great fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2b8b0f3705a8faab30332b84795e90af612bc3","amp;dn":"Topkapi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2b8b0f3705a8faab30332b84795e90af612bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,43,139,15,55,5,168,250,171,48,51,43,132,121,94,144,175,97,43,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
