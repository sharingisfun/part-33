Photoshop comes equipped with some really effective healing and retouching tools that allow you to make the edits you need to a photo by removing any unflattering or distractive elements. \n\nWe'll begin by learning about the spot healing brush and how we can use it to remove blemishes from skin. Following this we'll demonstrate how we can use the healing brush to not only remove unwanted facial blemishes but also other elements of a photo and how it allows for a little more control when sampling pixels for healing. Along the way we'll discover the power of editing with the patch tool, the content-aware move tool, the clone stamp tool and other useful editing features to remove or re-position certain elements of an image. As we explore these tools, we'll also discuss editing non-destructively to preserve the original aspects of each image we work with. \n\nAfter watching this training you'll be better equipped when it comes to removing any distracting elements from your own images while still preserving the originals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c447b518be370fa540cf25aa619de73fcdf5e07a","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Healing+in+Photoshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c447b518be370fa540cf25aa619de73fcdf5e07a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,71,181,24,190,55,15,165,64,207,37,170,97,157,231,63,205,245,224,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
