That may explain why it ended on a massive cliffhanger and said &quot;End Part One&quot;. However, a Part Two has never surfaced but what was published was collected in Otherworld.\n\nHot off his work on INFINITE CRISIS, writer/artist Phil Jimenez (WONDER WOMAN, New X-Men, THE INVISIBLES) delivers an epic saga Ã¢â‚¬â€ combining the dramatic setup and ensemble cast of Lost with the fantasy of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and mind-bending technology of The Matrix. Picture a world at war with itself. An idyllic, pastoral land populated by mythological beings that battle endlessly with a nation-state made of pure technology. Into this maelstrom is thrust a group of young people, some friends, some strangers, plucked violently from Earth and imbued with superpowers. One in particular, Siobhan Moynihan, an aspiring singer and college student, is told she's the savior who will either end the war and save the Otherworld...or destroy it forever. Joined by inker Andy Lanning (WONDER WOMAN), the extra-sized first issue of OTHERWORLD takes readers on an exciting adventure filled with widescreen action that's sexy, smart and unlike anything VERTIGO has done before!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:947fea0908c75cc893ada3cda815001962a6c40e","amp;dn":"Otherworld+1-7+%282005%29+%5BVertigo%5D+%28Requested%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"947fea0908c75cc893ada3cda815001962a6c40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,127,234,9,8,199,92,200,147,173,163,205,168,21,0,25,98,166,196,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
