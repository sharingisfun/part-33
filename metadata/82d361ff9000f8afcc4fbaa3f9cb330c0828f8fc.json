I put these skills to work for the Sinclair Family, one of the magical mobs that run the tourist town of Cloudburst Falls. \r\n\r\nEveryone knows Victor Draconi wants to take over all the other Families--and kill every last Sinclair. What they don't know is that I'm on to him, and no way will I let the man who murdered my mom get away with hurting all the other people I care about. Especially when I've got places to break into, stuff to steal, and Devon Sinclair fighting right by my sideâ€¦ \r\n\r\n&quot;An adventurous ride you will never want to get off.&quot; --#1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L.
