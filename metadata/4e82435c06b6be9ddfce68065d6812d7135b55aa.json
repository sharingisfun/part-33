Play with friends or strangers in online play, or play offline with friends face-to-face!\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for Android\r\n\r\nCreatâ€‹ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of tâ€‹he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\r\n\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply. Player usernames and expressions are their own. Exploding Kittens, LLC is not responsible for and does not endorse player usernames or expressions\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n* Improve defusing a Kitten so that players can now place a Kitten in a random position in addition to first 5 or bottom.\r\n* Who placed the Kitten is now visible when you draw the Kitten.\r\n* Show how many turns left (slaps) when defusing so players are less likely to blow themselves up by accident.\r\n* Tweak drawing a card animation to be less subtle.\r\n* Performance improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\nUpdated\r\nJune 7, 2016\r\nSize\r\n41M\r\nInstalls\r\n50,000 - 100,000\r\nCurrent Version\r\n3.0.1\r\n\r\nRated 9+ for the following:\r\n\r\n Infrequent/Mild Profanity or Crude Humor\r\n\r\nBuy it if you like the game and support dev\r\n\r\nCredits to Lenov.ru\r\n\r\nTorrent by RnC\r\n\r\n[/quote]\r\n\r\nplay.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.explodingkittens.projectbombsquad&amp;hl=en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e82435c06b6be9ddfce68065d6812d7135b55aa","amp;dn":"Exploding+Kittens+Official+Cards+Game+v3+0+1+Mod+apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e82435c06b6be9ddfce68065d6812d7135b55aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,130,67,92,6,182,190,157,223,206,104,6,93,104,18,215,19,91,85,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
