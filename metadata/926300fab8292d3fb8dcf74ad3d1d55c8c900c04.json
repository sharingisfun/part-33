This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nJohn Fogarty is singing with one of these acts but it isn't Creedence Clearwater Revival.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which act had the most top 40 hits in 1972?&quot;\n\nThis is the only countdown where Casey gives the wrong chart position and then corrects himself Ã¢â‚¬Å“At number seven - oh, number six for this weekÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAt number 24 is Albert Hammond. Casey tells how his records used to outsell Elvis's.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which recording act for Motown was the first to hit number one?&quot;\n\nCasey also answers the question, &quot;Which day of the week has appeared in the most song titles?&quot;\n\nThen a listener answers his own question, &quot;What top ten recording that was first released on an album took the longest time to be later released as a single?&quot;\n\n40: I'll Be Your Shelter - Luther Ingram\n39: Relay - The Who\n38: You Ought To Be With Me - Al Green\n37: Harry Hippie - Bobby Womack\n36: Do You Wanna Dance - Bette Midler\n35: Reelin' And Rockin' - Chuck Berry\n34: Dreidel - Don Mclean\n33: Been To Canaan - Carole King\n32: Sitting - Cat Stevens\n31: Could It Be I'm Falling In Love - Spinners\n30: You Turn Me On I'm A Radio - Joni Mitchell\n29: Jambalaya - Blue Ridge Rangers\n28: Daddy's Home - Jermaine Jackson\n27: Smoke Gets In Your Eyes - Blue Haze\n26: Don't Expect Me To Be Your Friend - Lobo\n25: Rocky Mountain High - John Denver\n24: It Never Rains In Southern California - Albert Hammond\n23: Separate Ways - Elvis Presley\n22: Dancin' In The Moonlight - King Harvest\n21: Pieces Of April - Three Dog Night\n20: Living In The Past - Jethro Tull\n19: Love Jones - Brighter Side Of Darkness\n18: Do It Again - Steely Dan\n17: I Want To Be With You - Raspberries\n16: Keeper Of The Castle - Four Tops\n15: The World Is A Ghetto - War\n14: Don't Let Be Lonely Tonight - James Taylor\n13: Trouble Man - Marvin Gaye\n12: High High High - Paul McCartney\n11: Funny Face - Donna Fargo\n10: Oh Babe, What Would You Say - Hurricane Smith\n9: Why Can't We Live Together - Timmy Thomas\n8: Superfly - Curtis Mayfield\n7: Claire - Gilbert O'Sullivan\n6: Rockin' Pneumonia, Boogie Woogie Flu - Johnny Rivers\n5: Your Mama Don't Dance - Kenny Loggins\n4: Crocodile Rock - Elton John\n3: Me And Mrs. Jones - Billy Paul\n2: Superstition - Stevie Wonder\n1: You're So Vain - Carly Simon\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926300fab8292d3fb8dcf74ad3d1d55c8c900c04","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1973_January_20th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926300fab8292d3fb8dcf74ad3d1d55c8c900c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,99,0,250,184,41,45,63,184,220,247,74,211,209,213,92,140,144,12,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
