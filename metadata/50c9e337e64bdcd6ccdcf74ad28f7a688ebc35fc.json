The other principal of the band is lyricist and synthesizer player Tony Barry (though Watson also provides keyboard expertise). He had left Redcar for London in 1984, ending up as a pub manager. Watson, after working as a bingo caller, followed him down from the North East six years later, and stayed on his couch. They embarked on their musical adventures, with various day jobs enlisted to fund night recordings. \nTyrrel Corporation made their debut in 1990 with the release of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6 OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ClockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on tiny independent About Time Two Records. Straightaway it showcased their strengths. While the song was undoubtedly in tune with the modern house sound, they imposed their songwriting skills rather than simply working a groove. Ã¢â‚¬ËœA lot of the stuff around at the moment, you could never sit down and play it in a bar, but everything we do is a song and can be played that wayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attested Watson. \nSigning to Cooltempo (originally through Charlie ChesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Volante subsidiary) follow-up singles Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe BottleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoing HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ were equally effective, with critics drooling at what one described as the lyricism of the Smiths combined with the funk of Mr. Fingers. While Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6 OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ClockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ took British licensing laws to task, the time in question being the legal opening hour, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe BottleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ continued their drink associations with the mighty hookline Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe bottle is mightier than the penÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The subject matter of Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoing HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was much more downbeat, reflecting the sharp decline of the industrial North East and the death of its culture. This was a theme more fully explored in their debut album.
