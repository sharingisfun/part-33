At its helm is a young Aboriginal man who is well on his way to international fame and possible fortune. Daniel Walbidi paints the desert country that his parents walked out of 40 years ago. Now the Yulparitja elders are taking their most promising artist back to the desert heartland they left behind. Its an emotional Odyssey interwoven with archive pictures and first hand memories of a by gone age where spirits inhabited the land and each generation passed its survival skills and oral traditions to the next. The elders have been worried that their old territory of salt lakes and precious water holes has been neglected and so their journey home is both spiritual and creative through rediscovery and painting.\n\nProduced by Rebel Films Australia\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1404 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 768x460\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.67:1\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 96 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 22 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 242 MB\nSource: PDTV\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d13da1f09e7f9289c102161104b082df09ace1f4","amp;dn":"Al-Jazeera+Witness+2011+Desert+Heart+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d13da1f09e7f9289c102161104b082df09ace1f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,61,161,240,158,127,146,137,193,2,22,17,4,176,130,223,9,172,225,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
