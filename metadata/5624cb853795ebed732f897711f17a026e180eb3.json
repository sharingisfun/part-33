It was released in November 2004. The title was taken from the lyric, &quot;With the lights out, it's less dangerous&quot; from the band's 1991 &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; single. With the Lights Out set a record for single week sales of any box set, with 105,760 units sold. As of 2007, it has sold over 925,000 units in the United States alone, according to Nielson SoundScan. It has also been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\nBackground Rumors of a posthumous Nirvana box set, or anthology, first surfaced in the mid-1990s, not long after the death of the band's singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain in April 1994. It was eventually announced that a 45-track box set would be released in September 2001, to mark the 10th anniversary of the band's breakthrough album, Nevermind, but a legal battle between Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, and surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, precluded this from happening. Much of the dispute centered on &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;, a song recorded in January 1994 during the band's final studio session. Grohl and Novoselic had wanted it for the box set, but Love blocked the song's release, and sued them for control of Nirvana's legacy. Love's lawsuit asserted that &quot;the parties have fundamentally different concepts of how to manage the musical and artistic legacy of Kurt Cobain&quot;, which resulted &quot;in a stalemate of decision making.&quot; She believed that &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; would be &quot;wasted&quot; on a box set, and instead belonged on a single-disc compilation similar to the Beatles' 1. In 2002, the legal battle was settled, and &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; appeared on the &quot;best-of&quot; compilation Nirvana. This paved the way for what became the With the Lights Out box set, which arrived in November 2004, over three years after its original release date but with more music than had originally been promised, including an acoustic demo of &quot;You Know You're Right.&quot;.\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Heartbreaker [Live]\n[02] Anorexorcist\n[03] White Lace And Strange\n[04] Help Me I'm Hungry\n[05] Mrs. Butterworth [Demo]\n[06] If You Must [Demo]\n[07] Pen Cap Chew [Demo]\n[08] Downer [Live]\n[09] Floyd The Barber [Live]\n[10] Raunchola/Moby Dick [Live]\n[11] Beans\n[12] Don't Want It All\n[13] Clean Up Before She Comes\n[14] Polly [Home Recording]\n[15] About A Girl [Home Recording]\n[16] Blandest [Demo]\n[17] Dive [Demo]\n[18] They Hung Him On A Cross [Demo]\n[19] Grey Goose [Demo]\n[20] Ain't It A Shame [Demo]\n[21] Token Eastern Song [Demo]\n[22] Even In His Youth [Demo]\n[23] Polly [Demo]\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:11m:14s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Opinion\n[02] Lithium\n[03] Been A Son\n[04] Sliver\n[05] Where Did You Sleep Last Night\n[06] Pay To Play [Demo]\n[07] Here She Comes Now\n[08] Drain You [Demo]\n[09] Aneurysm\n[10] Smells Like Teen Spirit [Demo]\n[11] Breed (Rough Mix)\n[12] Verse Chorus Verse\n[13] Old Age\n[14] Endless, Nameless [Radio Appearance]\n[15] Dumb [Radio Appearance]\n[16] D-7 [Radio Appearance]\n[17] Oh The Guilt\n[18] Curmudgeon\n[19] Return Of The Rat\n[20] Smells Like Teen Spirit (Butch Vig Mix)\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:11m:20s\n\nCD-03 Track Listings\n\n[01] Rape Me [Acoustic]\n[02] Rape Me [Demo]\n[03] Scentless Apprentice [Rehearsal]\n[04] Heart-Shaped Box [Demo]\n[05] I Hate Myself And I Want To Die\n[06] Milk It [Demo]\n[07] Moist Vagina [Demo]\n[08] Gallons Of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through The Strip\n[09] The Other Improv\n[10] Serve The Servants [Acoustic]\n[11] Very Ape [Acoustic]\n[12] Pennyroyal Tea [Acoustic]\n[13] Marigold\n[14] Sappy\n[15] Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam [Demo]\n[16] Do Re Mi [Acoustic]\n[17] You Know You're Right [Acoustic]\n[18] All Apologies [Acoustic]\n\nCD-03 Play Time - 01h:13m:20s\n\nMusic Videos\n\n[01]\nNirvana - With The Lights Out [2004].mkv\nFormat : Matroska at 2 777 Kbps\nLength : 1.40 GiB for 1h 12mn 1s 296ms\n- Video #0 : AVC\nAspect : 1024 x 768 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n- Audio #0 : AAC\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\n[02]\nNirvana - Excerpts From The Bands Fooage Of The U.S Bleach Tours 1989.mkv\nFormat : Matroska at 1 473 Kbps\nLength : 35.6 MiB for 3mn 22s 553ms\n-Video #0 : AVC at 1 252 Kbps\nAspect : 768 x 576 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\n-Audio #0 : MPEG Audio at 192 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 03h:35m:54s\nTotal File Size....................... 2GBs (Including MP3s, Videos, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
