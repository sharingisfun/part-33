He was not a sophisticated musician or singer, but he had a wry and clever way with words: 'Mama, move your false teeth, papa wanna scratch your gums.' He sometimes sang as if he had a cleft palate and even recorded under the name Harelip Jack Dupree. This was an artistic conceit, as Dupree had excellent, clear articulation, particularly for a blues singer. - from Wikipedia\n\nThey released one album in 1967 under the name 'Champion Jack Dupree &amp; his Blues Band featuring Mickey Baker' Champion Jack Dupree &amp; his Blues Band Featuring Mickey Baker and one compilation in 1969 under the name 'Champion Jack Dupree &amp; Mickey 'Guitar' Baker' Jack and Mickey in Heavy Blues.
