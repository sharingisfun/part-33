Eclipse\n\n\nAfter five years, the &quot;trfkad flac series&quot; is back with this special release: acclaimed jazz guitarist Nguyen Le celebrating Pink Floyd masterpiece The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nNguyÃƒÂªn LÃƒÂª is a magician; his art reveals itself not only in his own compositions but also in his celebrations of the music of the past, where his approach to the latter resembles sculptures made of new clay. He's a flamboyant guitarist and, while he shows courteous deference to his source material, he has always expressed the full diversity of an imaginary world engendered by his own history, that of a nomad, self-taught virtuoso: his music feeds on influences embracing all continents, and is painted with colours drawn from jazz, rock, and a kind of world fusion permeated with light. Celebrating The Dark Side Of The Moon demonstrates that the imagination of NguyÃƒÂªn LÃƒÂª has indeed risen to power; it is no simple tribute to a record which made history. It fervently expresses the re-creation exempt from all imitation of a score which you can hear in filigree. LÃƒÂª produced and arranged the album, and adds five tracks of his own, interspersing the Pink Floyd material. Korean singing sensation Youn Sun Nah adds dramatic vocals and Michael Gibbs provides the orchestration. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 101\nArtist: Nguyen Le With Michael Gibbs and NDR Bigband\nAlbum: Celebrating The Dark Side Of The Moon \nYear: 2014\nGenre: Jazz\nSource: WEB\nRip credits: BOCKSCAR\nCodec: FLAC\nCovers: front","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef196826c54c4e5dab232099bdd0014cd4d1ec67","amp;dn":"Nguyen+Le+-+Celebrating+The+Dark+Side+Of...%5BFLAC-2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef196826c54c4e5dab232099bdd0014cd4d1ec67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,25,104,38,197,76,78,93,171,35,32,153,189,208,1,76,212,209,236,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
