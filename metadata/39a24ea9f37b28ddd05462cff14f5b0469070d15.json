Through the centuries maps have been wielded to promote any number of imperial, religious, and economic agendas, and have represented the idiosyncratic and uneasy fusion of science and subjectivity. Brotton also conjures the worlds that produced these notable works of cartography and tells the stories of those who created, used, and misused them for their own ends.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a24ea9f37b28ddd05462cff14f5b0469070d15","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+World+in+12+Maps+%282013+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a24ea9f37b28ddd05462cff14f5b0469070d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,162,78,169,243,123,40,221,208,84,98,207,241,79,91,4,105,7,13,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
