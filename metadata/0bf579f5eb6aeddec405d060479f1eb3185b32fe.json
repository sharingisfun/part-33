Award-winning photographer Mark Edward Harris has had rare access to this reclusive country, traveling within its borders as well as documenting life along its northern border with China and the highly militarized DMZ dividing North and South Korea. His images are amazing: the monumental architecture and empty streets of the capital; tightly controlled zones of economic and tourist trade with South Korea; mass games featuring 100,000 choreographed participants. Short essays, extended captions, and a foreword by North Korea expert Bruce Cumings further illuminate a country increasingly at the center of international politics.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bf579f5eb6aeddec405d060479f1eb3185b32fe","amp;dn":"Inside+North+Korea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bf579f5eb6aeddec405d060479f1eb3185b32fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,245,121,245,235,106,237,222,196,5,208,96,71,159,30,179,24,91,50,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
