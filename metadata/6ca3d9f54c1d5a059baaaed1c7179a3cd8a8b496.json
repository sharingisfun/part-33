Stage 3 will start at Lake Cunningham Regional Park on the east side of San Jose. San Jose has the distinction of hosting a stage of the Amgen Tour of California for each of the nine years of the race! While the racers canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see the south face of Mt. Hamilton at the start, they know that they will feel the start of the climb just five miles into the stage. This will be the first time the race has gone this way to the summit of Mt. Hamilton. It is long and steep climb with 22 switchbacks. The road is sure to be lined with thousands of spectators. The descent off of Mt. Hamilton is shorter than the ascent, but it is steeper and much more technical. Once off of Mt Hamilton, it is a long rolling road over San Antonio Valley Rd. Once the race reaches the twisty Mines Rd., it will be easy for a breakaway to form and quickly be out of sight from the peloton.\n\nAs the riders skirt the east side of Livermore, the race will hook into last year's route to Danville and the approach to Mount Diablo. The race up Mount Diablo in 2013 will still be fresh in many of the rider's minds. They will remember the initial climb, the flat run to &quot;The Junction&quot; and then the final relentless push to the summit. The winner here will almost certainly wear yellow on today's podium.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca3d9f54c1d5a059baaaed1c7179a3cd8a8b496","amp;dn":"2014+Amgen+Tour+of+California+-+Stage+3+-+San+Jose+to+Mt.+Diablo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca3d9f54c1d5a059baaaed1c7179a3cd8a8b496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,163,217,245,76,29,90,5,155,170,174,209,199,23,154,60,216,168,180,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
