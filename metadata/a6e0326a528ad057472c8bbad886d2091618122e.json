Brown, Thomas Poon\nFormat: PDF\nHardcover: 792 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 5th Edition Binder Ready Version edition (January 1, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 9781118083383\n\nThis text provides an introduction to organic chemistry for students who require the fundamentals of organic chemistry as a requirement for their major. It is most suited for a one semester organic chemistry course. In an attempt to highlight the relevance of the material to students, the authors place a strong emphasis on showing the interrelationship between organic chemistry and other areas of science, particularly the biological and health sciences. The text illustrates the use of organic chemistry as a tool in these sciences; it also stresses the organic compounds, both natural and synthetic, that surround us in everyday life: in pharmaceuticals, plastics, fibers, agrochemicals, surface coatings, toiletry preparations and cosmetics, food additives, adhesives, and elastomers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6e0326a528ad057472c8bbad886d2091618122e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Organic+Chemistry%2C+5th+Edition+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6e0326a528ad057472c8bbad886d2091618122e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,224,50,106,82,138,208,87,71,44,139,186,216,134,210,9,22,24,18,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
