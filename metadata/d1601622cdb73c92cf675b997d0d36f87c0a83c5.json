Not that the Temptations' versions of Smokey Robinson-penned Miracles and Mary Wells singles\nqualify as filler. Hardly, as Eddie Kendricks's falsetto makes a convincing stand-in for Robinson's on remakes of &quot;You've Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and &quot;What's So Good About Good Bye.&quot; Many of these tracks also underscore the strong doo-wop roots at the core of the Temptations' style, none more so than &quot;Baby, Baby I Need You,&quot; which barely bothers to update its '50s influences for mid-'60s ears. This minor gem comes complete with three hit singles in &quot;My Girl,&quot; &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do,&quot; and &quot;It's Growing.&quot; --Rickey Wright\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.The way you do the things you do                     [02:41]\n02.Baby, baby I need you                                [02:53]\n03.My girl                                              [02:45]\n04.What love has joined together                        [02:58]\n05.You'll lose A precious love                          [02:35]\n06.It's growing                                         [03:00]\n07.Who's lovin' you                                     [02:59]\n08.What's so good about good bye                        [02:40]\n09.You beat me to the punch                             [02:45]\n10.Way over there                                       [03:03]\n11.You've really got A hold on me                       [03:00]\n12.(you can) depend on me                               [02:32]\n________\n33:51 min\n 49,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
