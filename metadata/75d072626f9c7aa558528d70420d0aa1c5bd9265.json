Please seed and share!\n\nMany good wishes for recovery going out to X-Factor writer Peter David, who had a stroke last week.  :-(\n\n------\n\nZombies in King Arthur's Court.\n\nThat sums it up, but Knights of the Living Dead is so much more than a zippy high-concept mash-up. Written by Ron Wolfe and illustrated by Pinocchio Vampire Slayer's Dustin Higgins, Knights of the Living Dead transcends the brain-munching of most zombie fiction and examines the nature of ones soul and the essence of being.\n\nAll that PLUS brain eating and SWORDS! LOTS OF THEM.\n\nSeriously, this is a fun and cool comic which will (once it sees print) sit beside things like Pinocchio Vampire Slayer as great comics for Young Adults.\n\nWhile a print edition is planned, right now you can get your Medieval Zombies DIGITALLY, and best of all ISSUE #1 is FREE\n\nKnights of the Living Dead is also available at the iTunes Store and coming soon to Comixology, iVerse, Graphicly and BN.COM (for Nook and Nook Color).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d072626f9c7aa558528d70420d0aa1c5bd9265","amp;dn":"KNIGHTS+OF+THE+LIVING+DEAD+01+to+06+%282011-2012%29+REQUESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d072626f9c7aa558528d70420d0aa1c5bd9265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,208,114,98,111,156,122,165,88,82,141,112,66,13,10,161,197,189,146,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
