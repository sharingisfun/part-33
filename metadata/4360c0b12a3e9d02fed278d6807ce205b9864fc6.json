Especially since the Himura siblings seem to be gaining a better understanding of their unique abilities and talents--especially Morgan, who has always excelled at anything she's put her mind to. But, there's a reason why the Shadow Clan had been in hiding for centuries--and now that the Himuras are out in the open, their ancient enemy, the Ghost Clan, has wasted no time in tracking them down. Ready or not, today is the day the Ghost Clan takes the fight to the Shadow Clan!\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and Artnet for this release.\n\nLegend of the Shadow Clan #1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8297111&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8297111&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLegend of the Shadow Clan #2: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8373245&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8373245&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLegend of the Shadow Clan #3: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8452056&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8452056&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4360c0b12a3e9d02fed278d6807ce205b9864fc6","amp;dn":"Legend+of+the+Shadow+Clan+04+%284+covers%29+%281440%2B2048px-HD%29%28TaruNet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4360c0b12a3e9d02fed278d6807ce205b9864fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,96,192,177,42,62,157,2,254,210,120,214,128,124,226,5,185,134,79,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
