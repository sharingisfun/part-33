It is steadily shifting from the cheap-comedies to the more sensible kind of cinema. Natarang is the story of Guna- the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nachyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in the folk culture of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tamashaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. It is an impressive tale of what a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nachyaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a female imposter in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“tamashaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, has to undergo. It is based on a book by the same name written by Dr. Anand Yadav, Marathi litterateur and President of this yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Marathi Sahitya Sammelan. Having not read the book, I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really comment on how the movie fares compared to the acclaimed book. If looked at in isolation it does a fairly decent job.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa646b4fafc97a73f1a4aa9bc7d6504dbb2d232","amp;dn":"Natrang+2009+Full+mp3+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa646b4fafc97a73f1a4aa9bc7d6504dbb2d232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,166,70,180,250,252,151,167,63,26,74,169,188,125,101,4,219,178,210,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
