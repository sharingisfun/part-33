Under unit manager Tim McManus and Warden Leo Glynn, the inmates in Em City all struggle to fulfill their own needs. Some fight for power; either power over the drug trade or power over the other inmate factions. Others want money, either through slinging 'tits' (drugs), gambling or other scams. Others, Corrections officers and inmates alike, simply want to survive long enough to make parole or even to see tomorrow. The show gives a no-holds-barred account of prison life with all the plots, subplots and conflicts given context and explaination by the show's wheelchair-bound narrator, Augustus Hill.\n\nTrivia about Oz: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118421/trivia\n\nGet ready to enjoy one of the greatest Tv series of all time!\n\nWith a rating of 9.2/10 from over 15,000 voters on the internet movie data base, Oz is one of the greatest TV series of all time bar none!
