However, there are no tear jerker's here; Eight Ball is testament to this as it kicks the album off in modest style in which a typically bluesy intro is met by an echoed vocal to thrilling effect. Walking Man carries on this modest approach with the obedient lyrics you say jump, I say how high, my names Steve I'm the walking man. Just Like a King is a far more flamboyant affair, indulgent solos are fused with short breaks for vocals I'm a prize fighter baby, before folding back into a blues jam. This before the album only new track, Ready For Love, raps things up nicely with an array of loopy drums and vocoders.\n\nSeasick Steve Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A sixty-seventy-something year old ex-Hobo from Mississippi who over the last 5 years or so has gone from zero to hero. I guess it must have a lot to do with how authentic he is, as far removed from the pop scene as possible, apparently he still lives in a banged out old camper that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had forever. The only difference is that now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of Jack Daniels Whiskey cos they wanted to sponsor him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2226b463ff9aae4a900a05a84821c5e0ae7e049e","amp;dn":"Seasick+Steve+-+Songs+For+Elisabeth+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2226b463ff9aae4a900a05a84821c5e0ae7e049e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,38,180,99,255,154,174,74,144,10,5,168,72,33,197,224,174,126,4,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
