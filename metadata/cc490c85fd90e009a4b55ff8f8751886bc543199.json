Although opposed to the slave trade, Wilberforce believed that the 800,000 slaves owned by the British should remain in chains. He regarded them as unfit for freedom.\n\n\nThis program uncovers the real heroes of the battle against slavery. They were radical political activists, many of them women; fiery evangelical preachers who worked amongst the slaves; and thousands of slaves themselves, who rose up in rebellion to break the chains of their own bondage.\n\nFilesize.....: 500 MB\nRuntime......: 00:58:43\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.open2.net/slavery/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.open2.net/slavery/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.open2.net/slavery/breaking_chains.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.open2.net/slavery/breaking_chains.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc490c85fd90e009a4b55ff8f8751886bc543199","amp;dn":"The+Slavery+Business+-+Breaking+the+Chains+%283%2F3%29+BBC2+%7E+2005.08.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc490c85fd90e009a4b55ff8f8751886bc543199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,73,12,133,253,144,224,9,164,181,95,248,248,117,24,134,188,84,49,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
