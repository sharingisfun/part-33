This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.\n\nOne thing about MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Journal that is a little different from other menÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s magazines is that it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think MenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Journal is a good magazine. It is varied enough that most anyone will find something interesting to read and the price is very low.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33d7094386f6d8702528144f3fffdd1d1c7fe6dc","amp;dn":"Men%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2s+Journal-+January+2010+-+USA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33d7094386f6d8702528144f3fffdd1d1c7fe6dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,215,9,67,134,246,216,112,37,40,20,79,63,255,221,29,28,127,230,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
