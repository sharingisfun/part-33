The band enjoyed fanatical local success almost immediately and turned &quot;pro&quot; to go to Hamburg's famous &quot;Star Club&quot; of &quot;The Beatles&quot; notoriety, but were turned back at the border as being too young to get visas. They then spent six years playing the national club and college circuit alongside &quot;The Who&quot;, &quot;Rod Stewart&quot;, &quot;Jethro Tull&quot;, &quot;John Mayall Band&quot;, &quot;Jimi Hendrix&quot; and many others. They personally backed Blues giants &quot;Howlin Wolf&quot; and &quot;Freddie King&quot; on international tours. The band made single and album releases, but split in 1971.
