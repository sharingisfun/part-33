Python is a wonderful language to develop machine learning applications. As a dynamic language, it allows for fast exploration and experimentation. With its excellent collection of open source machine learning libraries you can focus on the task at hand while being able to quickly try out many ideas.\n\nThis book shows you exactly how to find patterns in your raw data. You will start by brushing up on your Python machine learning knowledge and introducing libraries. You'll quickly get to grips with serious, real-world projects on datasets, using modeling, creating recommendation systems. Later on, the book covers advanced topics such as topic modeling, basket analysis, and cloud computing. These will extend your abilities and enable you to create large complex systems.\n\nWith this book, you gain the tools and understanding required to build your own systems, tailored to solve your real-world data analysis problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5548a8efa2ea72d20bfdb3cb2a4c839cacfdf2d4","amp;dn":"Building+Machine+Learning+Systems+with+Python","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5548a8efa2ea72d20bfdb3cb2a4c839cacfdf2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,72,168,239,162,234,114,210,11,253,179,203,42,76,131,156,172,253,242,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
