PLEASE SEED THIS !!\n----------------------\n \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n \nWhat is FLAC? What is Lossless?\n-------------------------------\n\nFLAC is a lossless codec.\n\nThere are several lossless codecs; FLAC, APE and Wavpack are three of them.\n\nLossless means an exact 1:1 copy of the original CD, with PERFECT quality.\n\nMP3, for example, compresses the audio to make smaller files... \nbut when that is done, the quality suffers a lot in the process.\n\nFLAC does make the size smaller, but it does not destroy any audio data.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a lot like a .RAR archive, but much better.\n------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n \nHow do I listen to it? What can I do with FLAC files?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can play FLAC in Winamp or Foobar2000.\nIt works in a lot of other players as well.\n\nIf you want to, you can decode the files back to .WAV.\n\nTo do this, simply download the FLAC Frontend: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSimply drag the FLACs into the program and press DECODE.\n\nThen, if you want to, you can convert the .WAVs to a lossy format.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nAgain... PLEASE SEED THIS.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;ve been looking for this then _SEED_\n\nIf you like this then SEED. And KEEP SEEDING..!\n\nDon&amp;#039;t be a retarded leecher. Give back what you take.\n-----------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df52781bedbc83afab8bf8b839a26a8d207a85ff","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+9+OST+%5BFLAC%5D+%2ALossless%2A+__%2ARARE%2A__","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df52781bedbc83afab8bf8b839a26a8d207a85ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,82,120,27,237,188,131,175,171,139,248,184,57,162,106,141,32,122,133,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
