We'll examine the FBI's attempt to coverup that knowledge by releasing photos Thursday asking for the public's help, when all along they knew full well who they were looking for. We'll also get into other possible actors that could be involved in one of the most botched plots in the FBI's long rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ© of terror. Alex also analyzes the history of staged events and gives insight into what type of self inflicted wound the Boston bombing is. \n\nInfowars reporter David Knight also covers the CISPA bill passing the House, which could put your personal information in the hands of military organizations like the NSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
