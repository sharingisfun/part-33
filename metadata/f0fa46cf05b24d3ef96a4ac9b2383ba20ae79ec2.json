The work begins with an overview of Energy Technologies for a Sustainable Future, which examines the correlation between population, economy and energy consumption in the past, and reviews the conventional and renewable energy sources as well as the management of them to sustain the ever-growing energy demand in the future. The rest of the chapters are divided into 3 parts; the first part of the book, â€œEnergy Sources, Technologies and Environmentâ€, consists of 12 chapters, which include research on new energy technologies and evaluation of their environmental effects. The second part â€œAdvanced Energy Materialsâ€ includes 7 chapters devoted to research on material science for new energy technologies. The final section titled â€œEnergy Management, Economics and Policyâ€ is comprised of 10 chapters about planning, controlling and monitoring energy related processes together with the policies to satisfy the needs of increasing population and growing economy. The chapters are selected works from the International Conference on Energy and Management, which was organized by Istanbul Bilgi University Department of Energy Systems Engineering and PALMET Energy to share the knowledge on the recent trends, scientific developments, innovations and management methods in energy, and held on 5â€“7th June 2014 at Istanbul Bilgi University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fa46cf05b24d3ef96a4ac9b2383ba20ae79ec2","amp;dn":"Energy+Systems+and+Management+-+A.N.+Bilge+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0fa46cf05b24d3ef96a4ac9b2383ba20ae79ec2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,250,70,207,5,178,77,62,249,106,74,201,178,56,59,162,10,231,158,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
