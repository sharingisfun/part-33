It is about a pilot in the 1930\\\\\\&amp;#039;s who flies a \\\\\\&quot;Goose\\\\\\&quot; plane, water capable. Set in the South Pacific, it has interesting characters with decent acting, a cute dog who is smarter than his owner, and a lot of action. It mixes adventure with comedy, throw in a little romance, add some period tension, a gold monkey and this is what you get. Tales of the Gold Monkey starring Stephen Collins, Caitlin O\\\\\\&amp;#039;Heaney, Jeff McKay and Roddy McDowell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50eba0511870856948ddc0b6d86b44dce70daf7d","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+Gold+Monkey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50eba0511870856948ddc0b6d86b44dce70daf7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,235,160,81,24,112,133,105,72,221,192,182,216,107,68,220,231,13,175,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
