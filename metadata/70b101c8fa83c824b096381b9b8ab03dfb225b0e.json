Two thousand years from now, the Earth is nearly dead. A bold group of explorers led by philanthropist Thomm Coney pushes forward to take the first tentative steps out of Earth's solar system. Their quest: new worlds to colonize, so that humanity may yet have a chance at survival. Facing impossible odds, political agendas, and a fanatical terrorist regime bent on their destruction, Coney and his crew brave the dangers of a potentially volatile star drive in order to preserve a civilization intent not only on killing itself, but also on taking down every other living thing around it. Will mankind set aside its greed long enough to see a future amongst the stars? Collects Critical Millennium: The Dark Frontier #1-4 and contains new pages and a frontispiece and afterword by comic creator Chandra Free.\n\n\nCRITICAL MILLENNIUM - THE DARK FRONTIER ( HC )\n\n\nENJOY AND SEED...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b101c8fa83c824b096381b9b8ab03dfb225b0e","amp;dn":"CRITICAL+MILLENNIUM+-+THE+DARK+FRONTIER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b101c8fa83c824b096381b9b8ab03dfb225b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,177,1,200,250,131,200,36,176,150,56,27,155,138,176,61,251,34,91,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
