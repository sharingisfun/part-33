(1975)\nTV Movie  -  192 min  -  Comedy | Romance\nRatings: 8.6/10 from 3,815 users   \n\nA group of old friends have a tradition of going to a public bathing house on New Years eve. Occasionally too much vodka and beer makes two of them unconscious. The problem is that one of them (Sasha) has to go to Leningrad but another one (Zhenya) goes. Zhenya wakes up at Leningrad airport. Believing that he is still in Moscow he takes a taxi and goes home. The street name, building and even apartment number, the way an apartment complex looks the same and the key coincide completely - just typical Soviet-type 'economy' architecture. Imagine the surprise of Nadya when she enters her apartment and finds a man without trousers in her bed. What's more - Nadya's fiancÃƒÂ© also finds him there...\n\nDirector: Eldar Ryazanov\nWriters: Emil Braginskiy, Eldar Ryazanov\n\nCast\nCredited cast:\n \tAndrey Myagkov\t ...\t\nZhenya\n \tBarbara Brylska\t ...\t\nNadya\n \tYuriy Yakovlev\t ...\t\nIppolit\n \tAleksandr Shirvindt\t ...\t\nPavel, Zhenya's Friend\n \tGeorgiy Burkov\t ...\t\nMisha, Zhenya's Friend\n \tLiya Akhedzhakova\t ...\t\nNadya's Friend\n \tAleksandr Belyavskiy\t ...\t\nSasha\n \tLyubov Dobrzhanskaya\t ...\t\nZhenya's Mother\n \tOlga Naumenko\t ...\t\nGalya\n \tGotlib Roninson\t ...\t\nZhenya's Neighbour at the Airport\n \tEldar Ryazanov\t ...\t\nZhenya's Neighbour in the Plane\n \tLyubov Sokolova\t ...\t\nNadya's Mother\n \tValentina Talyzina\t ...\t\nNadya / Nadya's Friend (voice)\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n\nFor the part of Ippolit, Oleg Basilashvili was cast originally. However, due to obligations on the Leningrad stage he could not participate in the film. Yuriy Yakovlev was cast instead. However, you can see Basilashvili's photo when Nadya picks it up from the snow. \n\nThe two apartment buildings on &quot;3rd Constructors St., 25&quot; which are supposed to be located in Moscow and Leningrad were actual buildings no. 125 and no. 113 on Vernadsky avenue in Moscow. They are only 700 meters apart. There is no &quot;3rd Constructors St.&quot; neither in Moscow, nor in Leningrad / St. Petersburg. \n\nThe director Eldar Ryazanov cast the Polish actress Barbara Brylska as Nadya. However, as she didn't speak Russian, her voice was dubbed by Valentina Talyzina. Talyzina appears in a small part as Nadya's friend along with Liya Akhedzhakova. \n\nGoofs\n\nContinuity \nNadya's phone changes its color. Most of the time it is red, however, in some scenes it is green.\n\nThe plane from Moscow to Leningrad is a Tupolev Tu-134. It has two double groups of seats. However, in the interior of the plane, it has two triple seat groups.\n\nErrors in geography \nThe service phone number on Nadya's elevator is 241-84-44 and has 7 digits. However, phone numbers in Leningrad had only 6 digits in 1975 (whereas Moscow numbers had 7), thus revealing that the shooting was actually done in Moscow instead of Leningrad.\n\nIn the scene where Nadya takes a nightly stroll through Leningrad, there is a tram passing behind her. It is a tram of the MTB-82 series, which were only used in Moscow by 1975.\n\nFactual errors \nThe word &quot;isklyuchitelno&quot; (exceptional) has been misspelled in the introduction text. The word is written as &quot;iskyuchitelno&quot;.\n\nQuotes\n\n[Zhenya has just come back from chasing Ippolit] \nZhenya: I tried to chase him down, but he drove away... He drives faster than I run. \n\nIppolit: Such muck, such vile muck, this fish galatine of yours! \n\nZhenya: 3rd Constructors St., 25, apartment 12, 4th floor. \nTaxi driver: I don't care if it's the 5th!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8244fe580bc7a3b4140bfe329b4060c3ba9d0cf1","amp;dn":"The+Irony+of+Fate%2C+or+Enjoy+Your+Bath%21+%281975%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8244fe580bc7a3b4140bfe329b4060c3ba9d0cf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,68,254,88,11,199,163,180,20,11,254,50,155,64,96,195,186,157,12,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
