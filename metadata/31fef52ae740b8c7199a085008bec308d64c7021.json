I wish I could have had this uploaded for you sooner, but I'm afraid I had some issues downloading it myself.  But I eventually got it downloaded and converted for you, and since I had the extra time, I was able to watch the whole episode while it encoded!  I think you'll really enjoy it, plenty of good Jedi action ... oh, and the little Twi'lek girl is just about the cutest little thing since Boo from Monster's, Inc.!\n\nOh yeah, and there's a part three to this story coming up next week as a certain Bada$$ Mother****er Jedi Master leads the full invasion against the occupying droid forces on Ryloth.  Then there's only one episode left this season :(  But I guess we can still look forward to the fact that the show's been contracted for a whole new year of episodes starting later in the Fall!\n\nS01E20 - &quot;Innocents of Ryloth&quot;\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.18 mbits/sec\nResolution...........: 624 x 352\nFPS..................: 23.98\nView Online Preview..:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/video/view/000769.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/video/view/000769.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo protect the droid guns keeping the Republic invasion force at bay, a deceptive tactical droid commander places Twi'lek prisoners in positions around the defensive guns as living shields.  This prompts General Obi-Wan Kenobi and his loyal clones to undertake a rescue assault mission which is &quot;difficult, but not impossible.&quot;\n\nEnjoy, and May the Force Be With You!\n\n\nScreen Shots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw120a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw120a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw120b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw120b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw120c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw120c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nYou can download Previous Episodes &amp; Star Wars films here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/VixenofVenus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/VixenofVenus/&lt;/a&gt;\nor\nor &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.demonoid.cc/files/?uid=3941911&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.demonoid.cc/files/?uid=3941911&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExpect future torrents for the episodes of this show ... from VoV :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
