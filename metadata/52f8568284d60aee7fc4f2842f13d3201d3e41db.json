This edgy police drama succeeds in capturing the hysteria the grips Tampa residents when a celebrity criminal . . . is found dead in a cyprus swamp with her throat cut and the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœEvilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ carved into her forehead.&quot;\n--New York Times Book Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Dead Detective is a meaty story that offers an intriguing and conflicted protagonist, a darkly fascinating victim, solid police procedural detail, a knowing look at the Tampa Bay area and its politics, an unlikely murderer, and a creepy denouement that hints that Harry [protagonist] will be back.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Booklist\n\n&quot;In his first new novel in seven years . . . Heffernan delivers a readable, tidy police procedural that echoes any number of popular television series, from The Mentalist to Criminal Minds, whose many fans will find this series debut enjoyable.&quot;\n--Library Journal\n\n&quot;After a lengthy hiatus, Edgar-winner Heffernan makes a welcome return ... Tough, troubled Harry Doyle will keep readers in line.&quot;\n--Kirkus Reviews\n\n&quot;Heffernan is a master of scene, setting, characterizations, plot, and dialogue.&quot;\n--Nelson DeMille\n\nHarry Doyle was murdered as a ten-year-old child and brought back to life by two Tampa cops. Twenty years later he has dedicated his life to putting killers behind bars as a homicide detective who has the unwanted ability to hear the postmortem whispers of murder victims. Dubbed &quot;The Dead Detective&quot; by his fellow cops, Doyle now faces his most difficult case--a beautiful murder victim who was a notorious child molester. It is a case that will shake Harry to his very core.\n\nWILLIAM HEFFERNAN, a three-time Pulitzer Prize nominee, is the author of fifteen novels, including such bestsellers as The Corsican and The Dinosaur Club (a New York Times bestseller).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f8568284d60aee7fc4f2842f13d3201d3e41db","amp;dn":"The+Dead+Detective+-+William+Heffernan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f8568284d60aee7fc4f2842f13d3201d3e41db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,248,86,130,132,214,10,238,127,196,242,132,47,19,211,32,29,62,65,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
