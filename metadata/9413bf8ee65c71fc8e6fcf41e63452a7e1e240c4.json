Derocher and Wayne Lynch\nJohns Hopkins University Press | March 2012 | ISBN-10: 1421403056 | ePUB | 229 pages | 28.4 mb\n\nThe polar bear, king of the Arctic, is one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most recognizable animals. Images of the majestic beasts roaming across the ice cap, plunging into frigid waters, and playing with furry cubs have come to symbolize the beauty and grandeur of the Arctic. Andrew E. Derocher and Wayne Lynch have spent decades following the bears, and this book offers the most comprehensive and readable review of their biology, ecology, behavior, and conservation.\nWith gripping photographs by Lynch, a preeminent wildlife photographer, and the personal stories of Derocher, this book is as stunning to look at as it is fascinating to read. It weaves together their remarkable experiences with the latest research to tell the amazing story of these Arctic predators, tracing the animals back to their evolutionary roots and looking ahead to the future of polar bears on a warming planet Earth.\nThrough informative and engaging language, Derocher carefully explains the sea ice ecosystem that is essential to the survival of polar bears. He addresses the threat of global warming to the ArcticÃ¢â‚¬â€home to polar bears for tens of thousands of yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€and describes in impressive detail their feeding habits, distribution, den ecology, and reproduction. LynchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid photographs capture all this and more as they chronicle the wide range of polar bear behavior, from family rituals to ferocious predatory practices.\nCaptivating, accurate, and inspiring, Polar Bears belongs in the hands of all who love the wild.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s24.postimg.org/d53h7gkut/dero.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s24.postimg.org/d53h7gkut/dero.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nAndrew E.
