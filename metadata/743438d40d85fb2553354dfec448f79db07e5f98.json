Magazine\n\nIf you like Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, Fuel, Queen, STP or any other band that just rocks, you will like this. \n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ Finding ClydeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supporting debut full-length release Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sacrifice it AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, available now via Bullfrog Records, is an effort that is definitely worth checking out in its entirety. While the band stays true to the active rock sound throughout the rest of the debut effort as found in the single, it is obvious that the band has enough additional creativity and prowess in its music gas tank to drive on endlessly without needing to refuel! While some other releases may grab your attention immediately and quickly fade away, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sacrifice it AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of those unique efforts that gets better with each listen. The quartet consisting of Joey Rivard (vocals / guitar), Tony Rivard (bass), Marc Scott (drums), and Jack Neymeiyer (guitar / keys) know how to rock it out. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter if you hear a song of theirs blasting at an arena event, pounding away on the radio, cranking on your stereo from their CD, or via your iPod it all sounds the same Ã¢â‚¬â€œ great! Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ Rick Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ScreamerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lindner, Alternative Revolt Magazine\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:743438d40d85fb2553354dfec448f79db07e5f98","amp;dn":"Finding+Clyde%3A+Sacrifice+It+All","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"743438d40d85fb2553354dfec448f79db07e5f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,52,56,212,13,133,251,37,83,53,77,254,196,72,247,157,176,126,95,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
