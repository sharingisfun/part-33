With Asia's economy and population booming, what changes will Julian detect from previous visits? Julian's journey begins rather inauspiciously in Hong Kong, where he foolishly volunteers to take one of Bruce Lee's famed one-inch punches at a martial arts school. After a sudden necessity to visit the bathroom shortly thereafter, it's at least a lesson learned. In Thailand, Julian tags along with investigative journalists and is recruited as an undercover spy to film an exposÃ© on illegal gambling. Once again Julian finds he might have got himself in a little deeper than he would have liked, another lesson learned. Typically, whenever Julian is involved, there appears to be a pattern forming. Subsequent visits to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and China also offer lots more education for Julian. Let's just say Julian is a great student of world travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Thailand \r\nIn Thailand Julian Hanton focuses on exploring Bangkok off the usual tourist path. He visits a 'Lady-boy cabaret show' then meets their lesser known 'Boy-Ladies' counterparts at a photo shoot for a magazine celebrating tom-boy culture. Julian practices his blue steel pose hanging with Bangkok's International model party scene before getting it punched off his face at a Muay Thai kickboxing session. Finally Julian visits the grisly forensic lab of a CSI investigator and Bangkok's leading party people 'Trasher' who teach him how to dance whilst looking cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3152 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1024 x 540\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 7\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.01 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv.nu/program/asian-times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbfc514087a940abc6ae6282dcc5bcfed8b434f","amp;dn":"Asian+Times+Series+1+2of7+Thailand+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fbfc514087a940abc6ae6282dcc5bcfed8b434f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,191,197,20,8,122,148,10,188,106,230,40,45,204,91,207,237,139,67,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
