My superior Nightingale, previously the last of England's wizardly governmental force, is trying to teach me proper schooling for a magician's apprentice. But even he doesn't have all the answers. Mostly I'm just a constable sworn to enforce the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Peace, with the occasional help from some unusual friends and a well-placed fire blast. With the new year, I have three main objectives, a) pass the detective exam so I can officially become a DC, b) work out what the hell my relationship with Lesley Mai, an old friend from the force and now fellow apprentice, is supposed to be, and most importantly, c) get through the year without destroying a major landmark.\n\nTwo out of three isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad, right?\n\nA mutilated body in Crawley means another murderer is on the loose. The prime suspect is one Robert Weil, who may either be a common serial killer or an associate of the twisted magician known as the Faceless Man -- a man whose previous encounters I've barely survived. I've also got a case about a town planner going under a tube train and another about a stolen grimoire.\n\nBut then I get word of something very odd happening in Elephant and Castle, on a housing estate designed by a nutter, built by charlatans, and inhabited by the truly desperate. If there's a connection to the Crawley case, I'll be entering some tricky waters of juristiction with the local river spirits. We have a prickly history, to say the least.\n\nJust the typical day for a magician constable.\n\n*Not my Rip, just seeding here.*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5fbd9468e355cf3fd68528a01e69f2a52b6480a","amp;dn":"Rivers+of+London+4_+Broken+Homes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5fbd9468e355cf3fd68528a01e69f2a52b6480a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,251,217,70,142,53,92,243,253,104,82,138,1,230,159,42,82,182,72,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
