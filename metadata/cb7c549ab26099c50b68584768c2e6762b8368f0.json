Everywhere All the Time presents an array of historical and contemporary alternatives to traditional schooling, demonstrating that childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capacity to learn decreases as soon as they enter bureaucratic, institutional facilities.\n\nCensus data in the United States alone places the number of home-schooled children at five hundred thousand. Trends point toward an increasing skepticism of the ability of public schoolsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and private ones, based on similar pedagogyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to give kids what they need to be healthy, self-directed life learners. Major themes in this book include: childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-directed learning, encouraging community-building and participation from parents in the learning process, critical thinking for active engagement and democratic self-governance, and alleviating the negative psychological effects of traditional schooling methods. It also includes the voices and artwork of alternatively schooled children themselves.\n\nFrom Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Illich, and Emma Goldman to John Taylor Gatto, John Holt, and Grace Llewellyn, Matt Hern has compiled an impressive cast of educational pioneers to aid parents, kids, and teachers in the quest for effective learning strategies.\n\nMatt Hern lives in Vancouver with his partner and daughters. He directs the Purple Thistle Centre (an alternative-to-school community center), is a founder of Vancouver Car-Free Day, is the author of Deschooling Our Lives and Field Day, and lectures widely. His writings have been published on six continents and in many languages.\nAbout the Author\nMatt Hern is the editor of Everywhere All the Time: A New Deschooling Reader, and the author of Deschooling Our Lives and Field Day.
