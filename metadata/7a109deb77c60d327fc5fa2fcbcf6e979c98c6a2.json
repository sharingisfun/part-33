This cover version of a 1960s Australian hit by the Easybeats was originally recorded to promote the Australian Made tour of Australia in early 1987, headlined by INXS and Barnes.\n\nTim Capello's cover of The Call's &quot;I Still Believe&quot; was featured in the film as well as on the soundtrack. Tim Capello makes a small cameo appearance in the movie playing the song at the Santa Carla boardwalk, with his saxophone and trademark bodybuilder muscles on display.\n\nThe soundtrack also features a cover version of The Doors' song &quot;People are Strange&quot; by Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. The song as it featured in the movie is an alternate, shortened version with a slightly different music arrangement. This version has not been released as of yet.\n\nThe theme song, &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot;, was originally recorded by Gerard McMahon (under his pseudonym of Gerard McMann) for the soundtrack, and later re-released on his self-titled album &quot;G Tom Mac&quot; in 2000. In the sequel of the film the theme song &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot; was covered by a Seattle based rock band &quot;Aiden&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Good Times&quot; by INXS and Jimmy Barnes ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:49 \n2.\t&quot;Lost in the Shadows (The Lost Boys)&quot; by Lou Gramm ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 6:17 \n3.\t&quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; by Roger Daltrey ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 6:09 (Elton John/Bernie Taupin) \n4.\t&quot;Laying Down the Law&quot; by INXS and Jimmy Barnes ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:24 \n5.\t&quot;People are Strange&quot; by Echo &amp; The Bunnymen ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:36 \n6.\t&quot;Cry Little Sister (Theme from The Lost Boys)&quot; by Gerard McMann ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 4:03 \n7.\t&quot;Power Play&quot; by Eddie &amp; the Tide ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:57 \n8.\t&quot;I Still Believe&quot; by Tim Capello ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:42 \n9.\t&quot;Beauty Has Her Way&quot; by Mummy Calls ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 3:56 \n10.\t&quot;To the Shock of Miss Louise&quot; by Thomas Newman ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 1:21 \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a109deb77c60d327fc5fa2fcbcf6e979c98c6a2","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Boys+%28Soundtrack%29+%5B+FLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a109deb77c60d327fc5fa2fcbcf6e979c98c6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,16,157,235,119,198,13,50,127,197,250,47,203,207,110,151,156,152,198,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
