From there, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll choose our favorite silhouette and begin drawing the rough line work of our character. Once weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve finished, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll begin refining and cleaning up the line work to prepare it for color. Next, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn one method of painting color values onto our character and blending them to create the illusion of a 3 dimensional image. Finally, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll walk through the storyboarding of a short animated sequence for our character. After completing this course, you will have a good idea of how to create and develop a character for animation. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also understand how to go about storyboarding out an animated sequence for a character.\n\n1.  Introduction and Project Overview\n2.  Idea generation through silhouettes\n3.
