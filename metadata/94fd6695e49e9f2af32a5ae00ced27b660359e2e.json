Rechristening himself Wayne Fontana after Elvis Presley's drummer, DJ Fontana, Fontana's first band was the Jets, a staple on the Manchester circuit through 1961-1962, but one which was doomed to failure.\n\nAccording to legend, the original Jets broke up when Fontana and bassist Bob Lang alone turned up for the most important audition of their young career, at the famed Oasis club. Hurriedly, Fontana press-ganged a couple of other local musicians, bystanders in the bar, into service -- drummer Ric Rothwell and guitarist Eric Stewart. Stewart was already an old hand on the Manchester music scene, having played with local heroes Gerry Lee and the Stagger Lees and Johnny Peters and the Jets (unrelated to Fontana's combo). That was still his regular band that evening at the Oasis, a situation that changed immediately after this ad hoc combo left the stage and was offered a Fontana label contract.\n\nRenaming the band after Dirk Boarded's then-recently released hit movie The Mindbenders (Fontana, of course, was allowed to keep his name!), the quartet's first release, in June 1963, was a cover of one of the aforementioned stage favorites, Fats Domino's &quot;My Girl Josephine,&quot; retitled &quot;Hello Josephine.&quot; It was not a major hit, peaking at number 46, and two further singles, &quot;For You, For You&quot; (October 1963) and a cover of the Diamonds' &quot;Little Darling'&quot; (February 1964), were even less successful. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kzftxqr5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kzftxqr5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nWell-chosen 20-track anthology, covering the hits and the best of their rare 1964-1968 singles, as well as a couple rare cuts from U.K. LPs and EPs. It's actually a distinct improvement upon its U.K. counterpart Hit Single Anthology, as it includes the fine &quot;It's Getting Harder All of the Time&quot;/&quot;Off and Running&quot; single from the To Sir With Love soundtrack, and eliminates some of the weak covers and Wayne Fontana solo singles.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:f9fpxq9hldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:f9fpxq9hldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001E5P&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001E5P&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
