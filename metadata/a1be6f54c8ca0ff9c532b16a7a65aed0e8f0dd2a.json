Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sara stalled,\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I guess I do.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ She remembered the night Solomon had visited her\nin her bedroom after Jason and Jimmy had shot him, but she hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t\nreally thought about him being a ghost that night; sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just\nbeen so glad to see her beloved feathered friend.\n\nSara and Seth looked at each other. Both of them knew that if\nanything would fall into the category of ghosts, Solomon would most\nlikely be it, but they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say anything, uncertain about telling\ntheir new friend their special secret.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Well, do you believe in ghosts?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Seth asked, looking intently at\nAnnetteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s serious face. Annette looked at Seth and then at Sara, who\nboth sat quietly, each waiting to hear the answer.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No, I just wondered if you did,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Annette answered abruptly. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey,\nletÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And without taking the time to execute a perfectly\ncalculated leap from the platform as she usually did, Annette grabbed\nthe swinging rope and jumped off as if she couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do so fast enough. . .\n\nSara, Book 3: A Talking Owl Is Worth a Thousand Words!\nBy: Esther Hicks, Jerry Hicks\nISBN13: 9781401911607\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 697","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1be6f54c8ca0ff9c532b16a7a65aed0e8f0dd2a","amp;dn":"Sara%2C+Book+3+A+Talking+Owl+Is+Worth+a+Thousand+Words+by+Esther+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1be6f54c8ca0ff9c532b16a7a65aed0e8f0dd2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,190,111,84,200,202,15,249,197,50,177,106,122,101,174,208,232,240,221,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
