The Nazis were the first to pursue the idea of building a disc-shaped aircraft. After the war, the Americans, Canadians and Russians all were able to build aircraft similar to the German prototype, perhaps based on the concepts smuggled out by German engineers. This episode looks at top secret flying saucer designs of the Air Force, with specific dates, times and locales of flights that may point to the real explanation behind the many UFO sightings beginning in 1947, and why the saucer design was abandoned for stealth technology.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e04bd504e26bba43d04a05c89d5f108a233c5072","amp;dn":"%5BHistory+Channel%5D+UFO+Files+-+Real+UFOs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e04bd504e26bba43d04a05c89d5f108a233c5072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,75,213,4,226,107,186,67,208,74,5,200,157,95,16,138,35,60,80,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
