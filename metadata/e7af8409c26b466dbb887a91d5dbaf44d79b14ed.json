The song was originally released from Henley's Building the Perfect Beast album.\n\nThe lyrics are a personal commentary, critical of then-modern American culture for being more concerned with self-gratification and hedonistic behaviors (e.g., dancing, partying, promiscuity, recreational drug use, etc.) than with serious issues such as domestic and foreign policies of their government. Ironically, it became a popular dance song, reaching #10 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs.\n\nThe commercial U.S. 7&quot; vinyl version has a slightly different intro than the LP version from Building The Perfect Beast.\n\nJohn Leland from Spin magazine wrote about the 12-inch single version of the song saying &quot;...this mother whomps from the git with punchy electronic drums and a mix that keeps one foot off the ground for a full seven-and-a-half minutes. Henley's post-hedonist vision of apocalypse is twisted&quot;.\n\nDonald Hugh &quot;Don&quot; Henley (born July 22, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter and drummer, best known as a founding member of the Eagles before launching a successful solo career. Henley was the drummer and lead vocalist for the Eagles from 1971Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1980, when the band broke up. Henley sings lead vocals on Eagles hits such as &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot;, &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;, and &quot;The Long Run&quot;.\n\nAfter the Eagles broke up in 1980, Henley pursued a solo career and released his debut album in 1982. He has released four studio albums, two compilation albums, and one live DVD. His solo hits include &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot;, &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot;, &quot;Sunset Grill&quot;, &quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot;, &quot;New York Minute&quot; and &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;.\n\nThe Eagles have sold over 120 million albums worldwide, won six Grammy Awards, had five #1 singles, 17 Top 40 singles, and six #1 albums. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and are the biggest selling American band in history. As a solo artist, Henley has sold over 10 million albums worldwide, had eight Top 40 singles, won two Grammys and five MTV Video Music Awards. Combined with the Eagles and as a solo artist, Henley has released 25 Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100. He has released seven studio albums with the Eagles and four as a solo artist. In 2008, he was ranked the 87th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_She_Wants_to_Do_Is_Dance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_She_Wants_to_Do_Is_Dance&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/japImAaEh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/japImAaEh&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 640x480 29.97fps 5800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 320kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:26\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
