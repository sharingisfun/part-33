In the foreword, the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s author describes the contents as Ã¢â‚¬Å“conundrums, brain-teasers, entertaining anecdotes, and unexpected comparisons,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ adding, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have quoted extensively from Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain and other writers, because, besides providing entertainment, the fantastic experiments these writers describe may well serve as instructive illustrations at physics classes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topics included how to jump from a moving car, and why, Ã¢â‚¬Å“according to the law of buoyancy, we would never drown in the Dead Sea.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ideas from this book are still used by science teachers today. Both volumes are translated from the Russian by A. Shkarovsky and were designed by L. Lamm and were published by Foreign Languages Publishing House. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2618b7408dd084ec127a80f85dd839f477a42654","amp;dn":"Physics+for+Entertainment+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2618b7408dd084ec127a80f85dd839f477a42654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,24,183,64,141,208,132,236,18,122,128,248,93,216,57,244,119,164,38,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
