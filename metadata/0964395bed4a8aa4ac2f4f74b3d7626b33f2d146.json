We have new Ã¢â‚¬Å“Staff OnlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ zones, which Prisoners are not permitted to enter. We have the first emergency service callout - the Fireman - which means you no longer need to watch your prison burn to the ground without being able to do anything about it. And weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve massively improved the Foundations tool so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much more intuitive and intelligent to use.\n\n\n= Staff Only sectors\nYou can now create Staff Only Sectors from the Deployment screen. They will show up Red.\nInmates will avoid these completely (unless misbehaving)\n\n= You can now call in Firemen to put out your prison fires. Use the new 911 Emergencies menu.\nFiremen are a special controllable unit with its own icons on the right of the screen.\nFiremen will automatically spray nearby fire, or you can press H to aim their hoses manually.\nTo dismiss firemen, send them all back to their fire engine.\n\n= The Foundations tool has been much improved. It is now much easier to expand existing buildings,\nand the door/entrance detection is much better at spotting valid entrances to new buildings.\n- You can now cancel foundations by right clicking on them, or right-click-dragging a box around them.\n\n- All construction tools now continue to work correctly even when the game is paused\n\n- There is a new tool in the Materials menu for demolishing walls (indoor and outdoor)\n\n- Localisation improvements:\nAll object/material/room/equipment/research names are now included in the language file (english.txt)\nLots of other hardcoded english has been moved into the language file for easy translation\n\n- You will no longer lose visibility of your indoor areas until your first Prisoners arrive\n\n- Main build toolbar tweeked to scale/layout better on higher resolutions\n\n- The Medical Ward has been renamed to the Infirmary\n\n- Fixed: You sometimes had to wait a very long time for prisoners to arrive when Continuous Intake was disabled\n\n- Fixed: Firing someone who occupies an office now vacates the office\n\n- Fixed: If an Administrator dies his office will now be released\n\n- Fixed: When a prisoner dies or escapes, his cell will now be released for re-use\n\n- Fixed a massive performance bug affecting the Intel HD graphics 4000 chipset","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0964395bed4a8aa4ac2f4f74b3d7626b33f2d146","amp;dn":"Prison+Architect+-+Alpha+5+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0964395bed4a8aa4ac2f4f74b3d7626b33f2d146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,100,57,91,237,74,138,164,172,47,79,116,179,215,98,107,51,242,209,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
