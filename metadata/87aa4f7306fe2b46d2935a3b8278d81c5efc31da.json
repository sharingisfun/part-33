The Dungeon Lord is in a mischievously macabre mood\r\nand no one is safe! In `A Clash of Pumpkins' , the new\r\nHalloween-inspired DLC for Dungeons 2, the armies of evil will face\r\nnew horrors including trigger-happy pumpkins, haunted forests and\r\nmurderous penguins across 3 all-new, eerily beautiful skirmish maps\r\n\r\nIncluded in `A Clash of Pumpkins':\r\n\r\nScare Island\r\nEvery year, the Alliance sends out its strongest and bravest\r\ncombatants to Scare Island - where the infuriatingly plucky knights\r\nmust prove themselves worthy in battle in an attempt to become\r\nlegendary heroes. With the Dungeon Lord in desperate need of a\r\nvacation, what could be more fitting than a trip to Scare Island?\r\nBloody and brutal days are coming - and the tourist industry of\r\nScare Island will never be the same again!\r\n\r\nGhostwood\r\nAn ancient and mysterious place once conquered by the Alliance - which\r\nwas probably as good an idea as a group of drunk college students\r\nmessing about with a Ouija board in an abandoned log cabin on an\r\nIndian burial site. Such ignorance shall surely be punished, as the\r\nhaunting Evil One sets forth to impose law and order in his own name\r\n\r\nRegicide\r\nAfter countless battles against the Alliance and other competing\r\nfactions, the Dungeon Lord is confronted with the most daunting terror\r\nthe nameless fantasy realm has ever seen - killer penguins! The\r\nwaddling, tailcoat-wearing nasties are relentlessly crashing down upon\r\nthe evil hordes, and there's only one way to stop them: the penguin\r\nking must be dethroned!\r\n\r\nNOTE: This releases is made standalone and contain all previously\r\nreleased DLC! Game does all feature all languages and updated to\r\nlatest build\r\n\r\nINSTALL NOTES\r\n\r\n1. Unpack the release\r\n2. Mount or burn image\r\n3. Install\r\n4.
