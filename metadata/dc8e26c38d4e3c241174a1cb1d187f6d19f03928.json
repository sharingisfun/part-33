Did he kill her? A snappy film noir based on a story by Cornell Woolrich.\n \nSay the name Walter Mirisch and one's thoughts jump to a proud producing credit on some of the best pictures of the 1960s -- when Mirisch wasn't making his own Oscar-winners (In the Heat of the Night) he was enabling producer-directors like Billy Wilder and Blake Edwards to fashion one unforgettable comedy after another.\n\nBut one must start somewhere. Walter Mirisch spent a decade producing &quot;programmers&quot; and B-pictures, mostly for Monogram and its upscale 'house label' Allied Artists. The Warners Archive Collection has released some of Monogram's more prestigious efforts but Mirisch's very first production wasn't among them. 1947's Fall Guy (no &quot;The&quot;) is a mini-budgeted B-pic hoping to compete with the trendy mystery thrillers that were then in vogue. Only years later would they be branded as Films Noir. Although Fall Guy isn't exactly a front-rank example of the filmic style, this &quot;Loser Noir&quot; did make the cut for the first Encyclopedia of Film Noir in the late 1970s.\n\nThe film's leading player &quot;Clifford&quot; Penn is a source of interest - he's really Leo Penn, the father of the famous star Sean Penn. The show can also boast a decent literary pedigree -- the author of the original story is the celebrated mystery novelist Cornell Woolrich. That fact is touted right on the posters, proving that Woolrich's name was a selling point, at least at this level of filmmaking... how often did the Monogram studio adapt published material?\n \nThis low budget Monogram film noir has a pleasing moody visual style and the usual dark noir theme of an innocent man trapped by circumstances beyond his control. A minor B-film, but it had some zip.\n \nTom Cochrane has no memory of the murder. What he remembers is a party, a few unusually powerful drinks, a blonde songstress, and then waking up woozy in an unfamiliar room where thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bloody knifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and a blonde stuffed lifeless in a closet. Held by the police, Tom escapes, beginning his desperate attempt to find out what happened and clear his name. The frequent noir theme of an innocent man trapped by circumstance plays out in the snappy Fall Guy, based on a story by Cornell Woolrich (Rear Window). Clifford (aka Leo) Penn, who would later have a prolific career as a TV director, portrays Cochrane. Robert Armstrong offers robust support as a cop who suspects Cochrane has been set up and helps him piece together clues. And Elisha Cook, Jr., whose career of playing seething weaklings includes the role of Wilmer in The Maltese Falcon, plays the elevator operator who may have vital information Cochrane needs.\n\nInteresting titbits about this movie,it was Walter Mirisch's very first movie and the lead actor Clifford&quot;Leo&quot;Penn is the father of Sean,it seems this was his only movie,he was also one of the actors blacklisted in the ealry 1950's and later moved into TV.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 409mb\nDuration.... 01:03:57\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 772kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 117kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48 KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc8e26c38d4e3c241174a1cb1d187f6d19f03928","amp;dn":"Fallguy+1947+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc8e26c38d4e3c241174a1cb1d187f6d19f03928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,142,38,195,141,78,60,36,17,116,161,203,29,24,127,109,25,240,57,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
