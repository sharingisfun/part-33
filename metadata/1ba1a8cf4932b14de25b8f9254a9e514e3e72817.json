The Charlatans return to the studio for the first time in seven years to play a couple of numbers from their twelfth album - and the first since founding member Jon Brookes died of brain cancer two years ago. Originally from Boston, classic US singer-songwriter James Taylor performs a couple of tracks from the first album he has recorded in 13 years. From LA, Mini Mansions make their debut on the show with a couple of numbers from their acclaimed second album The Great Pretenders. Soulful south Londoner Andreya Triana is stepping into the limelight with her second album Giants, having built her career around collaborations with many artists and producers.
