He sums it up in &quot;Lick a Shot&quot;: &quot;I&amp;#039;m a MC/ I don&amp;#039;t think/ Like you rap superstars&amp;#039;ll think.&quot; Meaning: yeah, he&amp;#039;s got a formula, but it&amp;#039;s uniquely his own. Whether you&amp;#039;ll dig it this time around is the question, and the answer comes down to personal taste. Do you like lyrically intricate songs? Do you like smoking hot beats (compliments of the Green Eyed Bandit himself, Erick Sermon)? Are you into extreme misogyny and violence? How&amp;#039;s your tolerance for songs about trying to get into nightclubs? All of this can be found in Malpractice. The album is creative, often clever, and filled with violent, nightmarish imagery. Even the insert artwork is unsettling. This won&amp;#039;t be an issue to diehard Redman fans who&amp;#039;ve eagerly awaited this long-delayed release. When all is said and done, this album is worth listening to, if only to catch up with Reggie Noble&amp;#039;s funniest alter ego, Soopaman Lova--this time he&amp;#039;s searching for his MIA mojo. --Rebecca Levine\n\n1.
