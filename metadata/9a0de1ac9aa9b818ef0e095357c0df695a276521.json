Emperor Hirohito bowed to the flags of the other nations. Japan has been waiting for the Games since 1940. But this is not the same Japan. Japan did not then make transistors and Emperors did not bow.&quot;\nHis guide, our guide, to Japan and its hosting of the world during the 62 Olympics, is a young woman named Koumiko Muraoka. She is asked gently, flirtatiously, to describe for us her thoughts and feelings towards this turbulent period of time, but through her coy reply?s it becomes clear that the mysteries of this world lay not in its political events, but in our guide herself.\n\nle MystÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re Koumiko\n\n--------------\n\nthis is a bueatiful film, and an excellent rip, but from a low quality vhs tape, so many parts are unclear, including some of the hardsubs. those with poor english may want to use the srt file over them.\n\nthanks VCirlot for the video\n\n--------------\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
