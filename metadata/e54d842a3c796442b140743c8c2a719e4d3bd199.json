Muhammad Ali: Through the Eyes of the World is a feature-length documentary which uses vintage films clips and interviews with his friends, family, and admirers to tell the full story of Ali's life and career. Celebrity interviews include James Earl Jones, Billy Crystal, Rod Steiger, and Billy Connolly.\n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 44 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 592\n\nFrame Height: 336\n\nFrame Rate: 30fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 109kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e54d842a3c796442b140743c8c2a719e4d3bd199","amp;dn":"Muhammad+Ali%3AThrough+the+Eyes+of+the+World%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e54d842a3c796442b140743c8c2a719e4d3bd199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,77,132,42,60,121,100,66,177,64,116,60,140,42,113,158,77,59,209,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
