One national newspaper dubbed her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe most exciting act in Nashville right now,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which might be regarded as small beer by more cynical observers of contemporary countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mawkish power ballad predilection, although it should certainly have had fellow Nashvillians Lambchop and Cortney Tidwell looking to their laurels.\n\nDelivering on that precocious promise, RoseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut long-player actually reins in her EPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feistier extremes somewhat to deliver 10 tracks of timeless, simply adorned (albeit by some dextrously restrained Music Row stalwarts) song-craft which, while they certainly doff a 10-gallon hat to the country canon, never seem constrained by Nashville tropes, old or new. Sure, there are sobbing pedal steel guitars and twanging Telecaster licks, but for the most part the sound is based on unfussy acoustic guitars, brushed drums and slivers of Hammond organ, all in service of RoseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s keening, compelling vocals.\n\nJaunty opener Learning to Ride is an elegant exemplar of this approachable indie/country/pop hybrid, while the less sunny Own Side offers a different lesson in crisp, country-rock economy. For the Rabbits, meanwhile, is a 1950s-tinged ballad bathed in delicious vibrato guitars; like Wanda Jackson covering Laura Veirs.\n\nMuch has been made of RoseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s singing voice, a thing of yearning clarity which canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but summon the ghost of country grand dames like Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, although she also brings a dreamier, Linda Ronstadt-like quality to the wistful New York City and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more than a hint of Lucinda WilliamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lived-in ache on the bruised Sinful Wishing Well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ no mean achievement for such a stripling chanteuse.\n\nLyrically, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perspicacious beyond her years, too. Indeed, the elongated smoking metaphor that pervades sprightly Shanghai Cigarettes (concluding with the poignant payoff couplet: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrying to quit will make you wish you didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t start / ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Cos the pack is as empty as the hole in your heartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is worthy of George Jones in his pomp.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/18/caitlin-rose/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/18/caitlin-rose/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f1f9b77224b707d8b3e216ce46805d9e20698b","amp;dn":"Caitlin+Rose...Own+Side+Now%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f1f9b77224b707d8b3e216ce46805d9e20698b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,241,249,183,114,36,183,7,216,179,226,22,206,70,128,93,158,32,105,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
