We have a vampire pimp who feeds on women. We have the cops who use no detection work whatsoever and then harass a guy on a street corner who tells them exactly what they are dealing with and where they can be found.\r\n\r\nWe have to be scrupulously fair to 7 Sins of the Vampire. The back of the DVD box admits that it was an independent film, shot on a sub-shoestring budget and had a cast consisting of local actors and friends and family. It is, therefore, going to have faults, but what it has as well is heart.\r\n\r\nNote that the film is dated as 2002 but did not receive distribution until 2012 and is listed as 2013 on IMDb.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x448, 29.970 fps, 1265 Kbps, 00h58m49s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 384 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/e7sdm3utf/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4sg6ji6o5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/mh7xb4if9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cz86b2wqt/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/52np2ulad/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324f5dd1eb6b96dbd548337cf410ce0c96d17d95","amp;dn":"7+Sins+of+the+Vampire+%282013+-+USA%29+indie+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324f5dd1eb6b96dbd548337cf410ce0c96d17d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,79,93,209,235,107,150,219,213,72,51,124,244,16,206,12,150,209,125,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
