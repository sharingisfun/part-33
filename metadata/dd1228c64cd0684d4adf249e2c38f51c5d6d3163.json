He also directed the videos for &quot;Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot;, also from Bat out of Hell II. Filming took place in Los Angeles County, California in July 1993; the opening chase was filmed at ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡vez Ravine, with the interior mansion scenes filmed at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills.[11] The cinematographer was Daniel Pearl, particularly known for filming The Texas Chain Saw Massacre in 1973. Pearl says that this video &quot;is one of my personal all-time favorite projects... I think the cinematography is pure, and it tells a story about the song.&quot;[15] He would later film the Chainsaw remake, which was produced by Bay.\n\nThe video is based on Beauty and the Beast and The Phantom of the Opera. Bob Keane did Meat Loaf&amp;#039;s make-up, which took up to two hours to apply. The make-up was designed to be simple and scary, yet &quot;with the ability to make him sympathetic.&quot;[16] It went over budget, and was filmed in 90Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°F heat, across four days. According to one executive, it &quot;probably had the budget of Four Weddings and a Funeral.&quot;[8] It is the abridged seven minute single version, rather than the twelve minute (11:58) album version.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1228c64cd0684d4adf249e2c38f51c5d6d3163","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+-+I%5C%27d+Do+Anything+For+Love+%28But+I+Won%5C%27t+Do+That%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1228c64cd0684d4adf249e2c38f51c5d6d3163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,18,40,198,76,208,104,77,74,223,36,158,44,56,245,28,93,109,49,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
