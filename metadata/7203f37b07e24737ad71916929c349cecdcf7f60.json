Ooor is it? Jake's a daddy now and has\na litter of pups to raise. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hope itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not too much of a stretch (get it?!)\nfor him. Finn's a celebrity hero in need of anonymity, but will he take his low\nprofile too far? What time is it? Time for Five. Five More Short Graybles,\nthat is! Speaking of sequels, Fionna and Cake are back for another\nflippy-floppy special episode. And The Lich is on the loose!
