YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll start with a ground-up primer on the JavaScript event modelÃ¢â‚¬â€key to avoiding many of the most common mistakes JavaScripters make. From there youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see tools and design patterns for turning that conceptual understanding into practical code.\n\nThe concepts in the book are illustrated with runnable examples drawn from both the browser and the Node.js server framework, incorporating complementary libraries including jQuery, Backbone.js, and Async.js. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to create dynamic web pages and highly concurrent servers by mastering the art of distributing events to where they need to be handled, rather than nesting callbacks within callbacks within callbacks.\n\nAsync JavaScript will get you up and running with real web development quickly. By the time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve finished the Promises chapter, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be parallelizing Ajax requests or running animations in sequence. By the end of the book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even know how to leverage Web Workers and AMD for JavaScript applications with cutting-edge performance. Most importantly, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the knowledge you need to write async code with confidence.\n\nWhat you need\nBasic knowledge of JavaScript is recommended. If you feel that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not up to speed, see the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Resources for Learning JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ section in the preface.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc474cd409eafdf34ee4f5e2eb1cc2f81aa7df3e","amp;dn":"Async+JavaScript+Opsylum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc474cd409eafdf34ee4f5e2eb1cc2f81aa7df3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,71,76,212,9,234,253,243,78,228,245,226,235,28,194,248,26,167,223,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
