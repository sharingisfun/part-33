Dying Breed\t6:47\n\nAllison Moorer's passionate power earned her first two albums substantial and well-deserved critical acclaim and a loyal fan base. This time, she's shifted away from eclectic neo-traditionalism to more contemporary (i.e. conventional) Nashville studio arrangements, and the approach is different enough that it may prove disconcerting to some fans of her earlier albums. Still, her original lyrics remain sharp and focused as she explores a wide spectrum of emotions. The magnificent &quot;Steal the Sun&quot; and acerbic &quot;Hey Jezebel&quot; balance the melancholy of &quot;Tumbling Down,&quot; the grim cautionary &quot;Dying Breed,&quot; and the torchy &quot;No Place for a Heart.&quot; While her vocal and compositional integrity remain intact, the question is what this budding paradigm shift portends for her future. Others who emerged as acclaimed neo-traditionalists (Sara Evans comes to mind) failed to significantly broaden their appeal until they firmly embraced the bland, mechanical predictability that still pervades Nashville. If Moorer is aiming for mainstream success by mollifying country radio, it's understandable. Whether that strategy works remains to be seen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b59eec1b1500c37ff248961341a6041d37a72f8","amp;dn":"Allison+Moorer+-+Miss+Fortune+%5B2002%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b59eec1b1500c37ff248961341a6041d37a72f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,89,238,193,177,80,12,55,255,36,137,97,52,26,96,65,211,122,114,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
