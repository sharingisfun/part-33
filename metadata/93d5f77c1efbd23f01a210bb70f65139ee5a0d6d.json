With Hitchens as your erudite and witty guide, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be led through a wealth of philosophy, literature, and scientific inquiry, including generous portions of the words of Lucretius, Benedict de Spinoza, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Mark Twain, George Eliot, Bertrand Russell, Emma Goldman, H. L. Mencken, Albert Einstein, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and many others well-known and lesser known. And theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all set in context and commented upon as only Christopher Hitchens--Ã¢â‚¬Å“political and literary journalist extraordinaireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Los Angeles Times)--can. Atheist? Believer? Uncertain? No matter: The Portable Atheist will speak to you and engage you every step of the way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93d5f77c1efbd23f01a210bb70f65139ee5a0d6d","amp;dn":"The+Portable+Atheist+-+Christopher+Hitchens+%28separate+chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93d5f77c1efbd23f01a210bb70f65139ee5a0d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,213,247,124,30,251,210,63,1,162,16,187,112,246,81,57,238,90,13,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
