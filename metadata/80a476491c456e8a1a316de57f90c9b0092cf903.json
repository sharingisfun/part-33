With his career seemingly fading and the fate of a book hinging on a publisher's decision, Miles is depressed with himself and what he hasn't achieved. Jack is a television actor whom some recognize but not many do, as if he were a minor actor who got a taste of success. With his best friend Miles, the two embark on a road trip through California's wine country. Miles wants to give his friend a nice sendoff before married life, while Jack simply wants to have a fling beforehand. As they're both nearing middle age with not much to show for it, the two will explore the vineyards while ultimately searching for their identities.\n\nDirector: Alexander Payne\nWriters: Rex Pickett (novel), Alexander Payne (screenplay)\nStars: Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen\n\nWon Oscar.
