All of them.  \n\nEvery precious one.  \n\nDepends on YOU.  \n\nThnx.\n\n---------------\n\nALSO - Fire a few shots across the bow of the Trolls that are Flaming these torrents in the Comments section.  Dont waste more than a few seconds of of your time; theres much more important for you to do; but dont make it so easy for them to avoid seeing what wasted breath they are so far, either.  Give them a quick chance to choose Life, over their Living Death.  Then move on. Pls.\n \n---------------\n\n'Dave Dellinger's close contact with other activists--from Martin Luther King, Jr., and Bayard Rustin to Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden--permits Dellinger to offer a frank review of their actions and motives, but his memoir is most remarkable for its depiction of the trials and tribulations of one man's life of conscience. &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-dellinger/from-yale-to-jail/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-dellinger/from-yale-to-jail/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dellinger .\n\n\n\nNOTE 1. Read by a very good ATT voice.  Dont like it?  Dont download it.  Dont complain.  Dont get in the way.\n\n\nNOTE 2. TEXT SCAN UNKNOWN QUALITY - Scanned years ago I don't recall how clean the text is, tho a spot check seems it is very good.\n\nKathy Kelly [ http://vcnv.org/speaker-bio/kathy-kelly ], often proposed for the Nobel Peace Prize, the person that does stuff like setting up human shields in Iraq to discourage the Bush bombing recommended Dave Dellinger as one of the two finest theorists and practitioners of Unviolent Theory, Wisdom, Knowledge....  I can't disagree.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e3cefa5db6520703b65b321c2043a7f1d416c9","amp;dn":"From+Yale+to+Jail+-+Dave+Dellinger+-+Join+Him+or+Step+Aside","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e3cefa5db6520703b65b321c2043a7f1d416c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,227,206,250,93,182,82,7,3,182,91,50,28,32,67,167,241,212,22,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
