It was released on the 1983 album Uh-Huh on Riva Records. It reached #8 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in early 1984. &quot;Pink Houses&quot; was ranked #439 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nRecorded in a farmhouse in Brownstown, Indiana, the song was inspired when Mellencamp was driving along an overpass on the way home to Bloomington, Indiana from the Indianapolis airport. There was an old black man sitting outside his little pink shotgun house with his cat in his arms, completely unperturbed by the traffic speeding along the highway in his front yard. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe waved, and I waved back,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Mellencamp said in an interview with Rolling Stone. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThat's how 'Pink Houses' started.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMusic video Producers: Don Gehman, Little Bastard. Director: Chris Gabrin. First aired in December 1983. Shot in Southern Indiana locations such as Seymour and Bloomington. The &quot;young man in a t-shirt&quot; segment was shot in Little York at the former Moody Grocery (among other proprietors) - it's now (2010) the local Masonic lodge.\n\nJohn Mellencamp, previously known by the stage names Johnny Cougar, John Cougar, and John Cougar Mellencamp, (born October 7, 1951) is an American rock singer-songwriter, musician, painter and occasional actor known for his catchy, populist brand of heartland rock that eschews synthesizers and other artificial sounds in favor of organic instrumentation.
