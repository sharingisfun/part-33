His family has been wronged and he goes to any lengths to find those responsible. \n\nThe second story, &quot;Girl in a Storm&quot;, is a different beast entirely. This story focuses more on the sex aspect than the violence, although it is not devoid of the latter. It's also a story about humanity, but how our loneliness at times can truly cause us to search out our desires in ways that are not always considered &quot;right&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a90f08676c5b7cf854ddf44affe2593ba0df3a","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Palmiotti+and+Justin+Gray+-+Sex+and+Violence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a90f08676c5b7cf854ddf44affe2593ba0df3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,169,15,8,103,108,91,124,248,84,221,244,74,255,226,89,59,160,223,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
