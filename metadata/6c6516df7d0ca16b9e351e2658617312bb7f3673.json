She was appointed Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 2003, after serving as a Special Bicentennial Consultant three years prior in 2000. Gluck has openly aligned herself to the school of Objectivist poets to which other poets like Louis Zukofsky, Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi belong. The Ã¢â‚¬ËœObjectivist poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ as defined by Louise Zukofsky, strive to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtreat poems as an object, and to emphasise sincerity, intelligence and the poetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to look clearly at the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by exploiting the resonances of small everyday words.  Gluck in one of her essays in praise of George Oppen in &quot;Proofs and Theories&quot; states her partiality towards any kind of poetry that Ã¢â‚¬Ëœapproaches silence and verges on disappearance.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢  Tony Hoagland, a literary critic and contemporary poet describes GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poetic ability, as one that lies in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcreation of terse and condensed dramatic forcesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. While Daniel Morris in &quot;Dedication to Hunger: The Poetry of Louis GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s&quot; develops the relation between economy of language and the economy of flesh through themes of starvation of the body in GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poetics. Poets like Emily Dickenson and Christina Rossetti have also demonstrated this poetics of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœanorexia minimalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in language. This behaviour can be understood through the patriarchal restrictions set upon the female where self-starvation and renunciation becomes a form of protest. In an article in the WomenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Review of Books, Donna Krolick Hollenberg mentions that the use of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrepeated negatives, remind us that GlÃƒÂ¼ck is a practised poet of the negative way.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Negative CapabilityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was explained by John Keats in his letter to George and Tom Keats (1817). Keats explained that negative capability referred to an idea that Ã¢â‚¬Å“when man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact &amp; reason.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book in ePUB format:\n\n* Poems 1962-2012 - Louise Gluck, pp.465 (Farrar, Straus and Giroux) \n\n===================================================================================\n\n\nPraise for Poems 1962-2012\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ms. GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new and career-spanning Poems 1962-2012 is a major event in this countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literature, perhaps this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most major . . . Put together, these compact volumes have a great novelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cohesiveness and raking moral intensity. They display a supple and prosecutorial mind interrogating not merely her own life but also the sensual and political nature of the world that spins around it. Her poems bring with them perilously low barometric pressure . . . Her father helped invent the X-acto knife. This is a cosmically sublime detail; no other poet slices with such accuracy and deadly intent . . . I look forward to whatever she writes next about aging, and I hope she goes on writing about it for a very long time indeed. Ms. GlÃƒÂ¼ck is fearless. Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhy love what you will lose?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ she asks. She answers her own question: Ã¢â‚¬ËœThere is nothing else to love.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Dwight Garner, The New York Times\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Poems 1962-2012 is a big book by a poet who values, above all, intensity of address, leanness of sentiment, and precision of speech . . . [She is] among the most moving poets of our era . . . GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innovation, in her best early poems, was to borrow the coolest American style and apply it to the hottest material: she was an objectivist of the emotions . . . This voice is not going to go away.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Dan Chiasson, The New Yorker\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest volume . . . reminds us that she has been not only a resourceful and versatile poet but also an astonishingly brave one. Brave in what sense? In the way she has steadily enlarged her range and idiom, working, to be sure, within the compass of her own nature, but ever testing the limits of her gift, so that the impression made by the work as a whole is not of limitation but of an overwhelming fullness of invention and abundance of life. GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection. She has found ways to engage with the world as it is without capitulating to its felt demand that she renounce any alternative sense of what is real. For a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion . . . Reality has existed for GlÃƒÂ¼ck simultaneously as foundation and irritant. She acknowledges what seems to her indisputably trueÃ¢â‚¬â€like the fact of death, or the loss of loveÃ¢â‚¬â€while refusing to concede that the soul is merely what Wallace Stevens once called a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrustic memorial of a beliefÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ long consigned to irrelevance. Fierce in her determination to see things as they are, she fashions poems that suggest how much more there is to know than she can say. Incorrigibly committed to lucidity and alert against even the slightest imprecision, she ventures in and ventures out as if full comprehensibility were a chimera and an obstacle to true understanding . . . Reading GlÃƒÂ¼ck, it is hard not to think that the poems come from what R.P. Blackmur once described as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe whole history of the common language of the mind, or as Yeats calls it of the soul.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ And yetÃ¢â‚¬â€one more time and yetÃ¢â‚¬â€GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s poems can also be thought of as expressions of a very particular and troubled person, a poet determined to get to the bottom of her own experience without making an idol of Ã¢â‚¬ËœrealityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or brute suffering. As with other great poets, GlÃƒÂ¼ck does not invite paraphrase. Her poems at their bestÃ¢â‚¬â€and they are very often at their bestÃ¢â‚¬â€embody not just the rage to order, but also the rage to identify a Ã¢â‚¬ËœtruthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that no order can approximate or touch.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Robert Boyers, The Nation\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“GlÃƒÂ¼ck is as important and influential a poet as we have in America . . . GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work is all edges . . . the sharper ones can inflict heavenly hurt, where the meanings are. If you want to know about the last half-century of American poetry, you need to read these poems.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Michael Robbins, The Los Angeles Review of Books\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Since 1962 few American poets have succeeded as well in writing as a poet of poise as Louise GlÃƒÂ¼ck . . . GlÃƒÂ¼ck has long favored subjects of disharmony as a means to achieve a poetry of poise . . . GlÃƒÂ¼ck forces pain to take a bow in her poems. She requires tenderness to admit its shadow afflictions . . . Her poems convulse, twinge, and even gripe. Or, as she asks in an early poem: Ã¢â‚¬ËœHow much beauty can a person bear?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ And yet even burdened with the weight of so much distress, her poems most certainly embody the beautiful. That is, distress as beauty. When you consider the ferocious, relentless, merciless, unforgiving, and self-diagnostic stance that has characterized her poems for 50 years as a means to render beauty, you come to see that she is unparalleled in finding beauty in tribulation more so than any American poet since Emily Dickinson . . . Friction and discordance are the means by which she finds insightÃ¢â‚¬â€and that insight conveys poise in the face of unrequited desire. Which makes her a poet of yearning tooÃ¢â‚¬â€and so she often conveys yearning (even if one does not achieve the object of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yearning) as a form of beauty as well. These negations have made her the finest poet of austere emotion that we have,Ã¢â‚¬â€with her signature tone of solemnity a mark of beauty, too. To withstand negation is to unveil poise.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€David Biespiel, The Oregonian\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Emerging from a reading of this accomplished collected works is like having run a rigorous marathon. While in shorter individual collections Louise GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s consistency of tone has the effect of unifying her poems, in a much larger assemblage like this one, the boundaries of individual poems seem to dissolve and merge into what has the feel of one long, extended poem that is an invigorating but demanding read. GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice is like no other in modern American poetry. Her poetic domainÃ¢â‚¬â€like that of Wallace StevensÃ¢â‚¬â€lies in the seclusion of analytic thought. The seamless continuity of her verse suggests a mind in perpetual meditation, deliberating in a state of waking dream. Her laserlike intensity purifies as it objectifies and erodes, leaving an indelible impression on the reader.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Rita Signorelli-Pappas, World Literature Today\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Eleven previous collections are gathered here, echoing with synergistic reverberations, as GlÃƒÂ¼ck exploresÃ¢â‚¬â€with growing mastery and imagination, candor and wide-ranging inquiry, intensity and restraintÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe turmoil of family life; the fever, bliss, and misery of lust and love; the circular battle with the self; age and death. For 50 years, GlÃƒÂ¼ck, a former U.S. poet laureate and Pulitzer winner, has been writing poems of formal elegance, psychic intimacy, brainy fusion, emotional acuity, and aesthetic splendor. As intimate and immediate as her lyrics are, GlÃƒÂ¼ck is also vatic, summoning the old gods and the timeless myths to trace the human stream of consciousness, experience, and dream. GlÃƒÂ¼ckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assembled lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work of shadow and fire, driven by Ã¢â‚¬Ëœperception of beauty, desire for knowledge,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ is magnificent.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Though GlÃƒÂ¼ck has held national fame since the late 1970s for her terse, pared-down poems, this first career-spanning collected may be the most widely noted, and the most praised, collected poems in some time. Here is the Pulitzer PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning The Wild Iris (1992), whose talking flowers encapsulated birth, death, loss, and hope; here are the starkly framed family memories of her controversial Ararat (1990), and the careful, self-accusing humor of late work such as The Seven Ages (2001). Here, too, are the stormy, almost overexposed poems (reminiscent of Robert Lowell) with which she began, and the calmly uncompromising universals of A Village Life (2009), where Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe mountain stands like a beacon, to remind the night that the earth exists.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Through screens of familiar stories (Achilles, Penelope, Dante) or through overtÃ¢â‚¬â€albeit terseÃ¢â‚¬â€autobiography, GlÃƒÂ¼ck at once scrutinizes her own life and reflects on the process by which poems get made, the way that we, too, may come to know ourselves: Ã¢â‚¬ËœLike everyone else,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ she reflects, Ã¢â‚¬ËœI had a story,/ a point of view.// A few words were all I needed:/ nourish, sustain, attack.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Turning life stories to myths; myths to cool, scary proverbs, GlÃƒÂ¼ck compares her style accurately to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbright light through the bare tree,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ her process of writing to spying, to silent listening: Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn my own mind, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m invisibleÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m dangerous.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly (starred review)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6516df7d0ca16b9e351e2658617312bb7f3673","amp;dn":"Louise+Gluck+-+Poems+1962-2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6516df7d0ca16b9e351e2658617312bb7f3673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,101,22,223,125,12,161,107,158,53,30,38,88,97,115,18,187,127,54,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
