Sure, performers before him where writing and singing of the same things that he was, that was what the jazz/blues movement is all about. Marvin Gaye gave mainstream acceptance to a sound that might have never come to light without him.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.How sweet it is (to be loved by you)                 [03:01]\n02.Your precious love (with tammi terrell)              [03:06]\n03.Ain't that peculiar                                  [03:02]\n04.If I could build my whole world around you           [02:24]\n     (with tammi terrell)\n05.That's the way love is                               [03:46]\n06.You're all I need to get by (with tammi terrell)     [02:52]\n07.I'll be doggone                                      [02:50]\n08.I heard it through the grapevine                     [03:17]\n09.Too busy thinking about my baby                      [02:58]\n10.What's going on                                      [03:53]\n11.Ain't nothing like the real thing                    [02:17]\n     (with tammi terrell)\n12.Inner city blues (make me wanna holler)              [03:01]\n13.Mercy mercy me (the ecology)                         [03:17]\n14.Trouble man                                          [03:52]\n15.Let's get it on                                      [04:02]\n16.Distant lover                                        [04:20]\n17.Got to give it up (part 1)                           [04:13]\n________\n56:11 min\n 80,8 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.

What did you tell them?\nThat HHI is dropping rips like LSD? Call us crazy...We think they might already know that. Didn't your parents ever teach you that it's not nice to snitch? Especially when the people you try and snitch on can figure out who you are. Here's our doc drop dedicated to you. We're sure the information looks familiar, as it's yours.\n\n\nDavid Brooks BD ~BD~ BoaterDave\nJersey Cottage\n86 Granary Lane\nBudleigh Salterton\nDevon\nEX9 6ER\nUnited Kingdom\nPhone: 44-1395-443340\nPic: DavidBrooks.jpg (included with release)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a3ab6588c6180d2e208f1d7aadb687ea864b5e","amp;dn":"Marvin_Gaye-Every_Great_Motown_Hit-%28Retail%29-2000-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60a3ab6588c6180d2e208f1d7aadb687ea864b5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,163,171,101,136,198,24,13,46,32,143,29,122,173,182,135,234,134,75,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
