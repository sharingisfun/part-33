First published in 1972, the original name for GarfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic protagonist is Paul Benjamin, and he was a CPA. The basics of the story are the sameÃ¢â‚¬â€a liberal, non-violent citizen turns into a one-man army to battle injustice and street violenceÃ¢â‚¬â€but the similarities end there. I love me some Bronson, and think that the film is one of the best New York crime thrillers to come out of the 1970s, but when it comes right down to it, the old adage is true: the book is better than the movie.\n\n&quot;Death Sentence&quot; by Brian Garfield (1975) \nThree years later, in 1975, Garfield unveiled a sequel. Death Sentence is a desolate but distinguished suspense novel that follows Paul as he leaves New York and continues his war against crime on the streets of Chicago. Set in the weeks around Christmas and New Years, Paul is trying to settle into a new life and a new job, but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go of the past just yet. \n\nLink to ebooks &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8769650/Death_Wish_and_Death_Sentence_audiobooks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8769650/Death_Wish_and_Death_Sentence_audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496f4d7000a37a3a24c480737f41b771de22c7aa","amp;dn":"Death+Wish+and+Death+Sentence+E-books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496f4d7000a37a3a24c480737f41b771de22c7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,111,77,112,0,163,122,58,36,196,128,115,127,65,183,113,222,34,199,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
