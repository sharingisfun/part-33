It was narrated by actor Sir Peter Ustinov. While generally highly accurate, the series is marred with repeated factual errors where the narrator uses the term 'Russian' where the term 'Soviet' would be correct. For example, the title of the episode 'Russian Giants' is particularly egregious, as the Antonov aircraft profiled therein could only be described as 'Soviet' or 'Ukrainian', never 'Russian'.\n\nEpisodes:\n1.
