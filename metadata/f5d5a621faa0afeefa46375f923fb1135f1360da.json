JACKSON  -  Automatic Lover  (1978)\n\n\n\n\n      Space, formally Didier Marouani &amp; Space, are a French electronic music band from the city of Marseille active from 1977 through 1980.They are considered as one of the most notable artists of the short lived space disco music scene, and early pioneers of Eurodance electronica subgenre.\n     The first three albums - &quot;Magic Fly&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Just Blue&quot; - were an immediate success (they sold over 12 million records all over the world). The album Magic Fly, which is widely considered to be their best work, was released in audio cd in 2001, 24 years after its original release. Although Didier Marouani left the band in 1979, the other two members Roland Romanelli and Jannick Top released in 1980 the album &quot;Deeper Zone&quot; under the name of Space. Then Space officially split up in 1981.\n\n     &quot;Supernature&quot; is the title track of Cerrone's 1977 album. &quot;Supernature (Cerrone III)&quot;, along with the tracks &quot;Give Me Love&quot; and &quot;Love is Here&quot;, hit #1 on the disco/dance charts early in 1978. The single crossed over to both the pop charts, where it peaked at #70 (#8 in the UK) and the soul charts, where it peaked at #72. The lyrics were written by a young Lene Lovich, though she was not credited. The song has an environmental theme, imagining a future in which the use of artificial chemicals in agriculture has caused &quot;creatures down below&quot; to emerge and &quot;take their sweet revenge&quot; against mankind.\n\n       Rockets were a French space rock band that formed in Paris in 1974. In their most successful era (1977ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1982) the line-up comprised vocalist Christian Le Bartz, bassist and vocalist &quot;Little&quot; GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard L'Her, guitarist and keyboardist Alain Maratrat, drummer and percussionist Alain Groetzinger, and keyboardist Fabrice Quagliotti. The band went through a number of name changes, being known as the Rocket Men and Rok-Etz, among others. \n\n      Dee D. Jackson is a musician and singer. In the 1970s, she worked as a film producer, before moving into music. Jackson released her first single - &quot;Man of a Man&quot; (1978), but this has not been included in any of her albums. The single did not get the public's attention. Her next attempt was the release of her biggest single, &quot;Automatic Lover&quot;  reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart, #1 in Argentina, Italy, France, Spain, Turkey and Japan. In Germany the single reached #5. It also climbed high up the South African singles charts. In 1978 she released her first album Cosmic Curves, &quot;Thunder &amp; Lightning&quot; was released at the end of 1980 and  &quot;Blame It on The Rain&quot; was issued in 1995.\n    ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d5a621faa0afeefa46375f923fb1135f1360da","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+341","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d5a621faa0afeefa46375f923fb1135f1360da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,213,166,33,250,160,175,238,250,70,55,95,146,63,177,19,95,19,96,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
