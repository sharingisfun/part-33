Time as noise rockers, alternative               |\n|   trailblazers, and even time as charting artists. They've had quite a       |\n|   time by now. Now they have their own studio to explore their sound in      |\n|   and a rock era fading past. Here they've taken up their mantle as          |\n|   fiercely independent and exploratory artists once more.                    |\n|                                                                              |\n|   A Thousand Leaves sounds like little else in the Sonic catalog due to      |\n|   their willingness to leave rock territory behind and carve out a new       |\n|   niche in their own land of open tunings and three guitar luster.           |\n|                                                                              |\n|   It begins with crunching, crackling feedback. Not like the Sonic Youth     |\n|   of old. Here, there seems to be more body to the noise. It doesn't         |\n|   accentuate the notes; it is the whole of the music. Kim's voice wanders    |\n|   in. It really doesn't matter that she's referencing Lewis Carroll or       |\n|   talking about sexism. Her voice is actually warm, slightly manipulated,    |\n|   but reassuring in a way it never was before. Contre le Sexisme is a        |\n|   declaration of Kim's presence on the album and the femininity that         |\n|   pervades it.                                                               |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Sunday follows. While a great single, it doesn't rock out like earlier     |\n|   Sonics. It seems more laconic, more willful, and revels in noise as        |\n|   beauty, with not a hint of pop convention adorning it. The guitars here    |\n|   crunch and growl with abandon, then plunge into a howl and scream solo     |\n|   that fans have never heard before. Here there is texture, atmosphere,      |\n|   even emotion that had been so absent during the rock era of the            |\n|   nineties. This is beautiful.                                               |\n|                                                                              |\n|   What's that sound squeezing your head out of shape? It's the intro to      |\n|   &quot;Female Mechanic Now On Duty&quot;. Angry, politicized, and slightly            |\n|   ridiculous, it nevertheless works. The guitar interplay is bliss, and      |\n|   the second half's percussion is just sublime. Liquid guitar may not save   |\n|   the lyrics or vocals, but really, that's not at all out of place for       |\n|   Kim. And Steve Shelley's percussion makes up for it, I swear.              |\n|                                                                              |\n|   &quot;Hoarfrost&quot; is a highlight here, one of the best Lee songs. Cold, wintry   |\n|   guitar plucking leads you into a snow-covered forest, and while the        |\n|   spiders build their silver webs, you just gaze around at all the beauty    |\n|   that threatens to swallow you.                                             |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Lee contributes another highlight, 'Karen Koltrane', precursor to Murray   |\n|   Street's 'Karenology'. Though nearly grating in its aggressive             |\n|   dissonance, the song is saved from being a particularly abrasive           |\n|   curiosity by an utterly incredible instrumental. The multi-part, fluid     |\n|   and intricate guitar interplay makes this a latter-day classic.            |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Aside from these highlights, some of the songs don't quite perform as      |\n|   well. Thurston's vocals in Wildflower Soul are too fragile, and Kim gets   |\n|   a bit obnoxious and overly silly from time to time. However, overall,      |\n|   the album is consistently engaging and pleasing. This album finds beauty   |\n|   in noise like early Sonic Youth, only here tempered by maturity and        |\n|   wisdom. Though Kim's songs get to be a little too much, the thematic       |\n|   unity of the album and wonderful guitar sounds that these rockers have     |\n|   found again are worth a few bad moments.
