While the quality of his accompaniments varies tremendously, Hawkins&amp;#039;s contributions don&amp;#039;t. The earliest session climaxes with his classic solo version of &quot;Body and Soul,&quot; a landmark in both the harmonic language of jazz and improvised musical architecture. Another four tracks come from a 1940 octet date with some of Hawkins&amp;#039;s old associates from the Fletcher Henderson band, Benny Carter (on trumpet here) and J.C. Higginbotham on trombone, along with the underrated clarinetist Danny Polo. It&amp;#039;s small-group swing of the first order, with touches of traditional jazz in the improvised ensembles.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea361953dc0903f3b6d3aa5996960bb8672fb16","amp;dn":"Coleman+Hawkins+-+Body+%26+Soul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea361953dc0903f3b6d3aa5996960bb8672fb16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,163,97,149,61,192,144,63,59,109,58,165,153,105,96,187,134,114,251,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
