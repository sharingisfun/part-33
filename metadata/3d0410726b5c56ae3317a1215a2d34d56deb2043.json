D.C would crush southampton.\n\nThis gave me an idea to do some tinkering and I have. \n\n6 MLS teams are now in the Barclay\\&amp;#039;s Premiership. (D.C. United, F.C. Dallas, New England, Houston, Chivas and Chicago). 6 English teams are now in the MLS.  I took the 3 promoted teams and the 15th 16th 17th teams in the EPL from last season. So, MLS fans, say hello to Reading, Watford, Sheff Utd, Aston Villa, Man City and Portsmouth.\n\nNow I know what you\\&amp;#039;re thinking. Hey that\\&amp;#039;s not fair. The US teams are broke! I fixed that, not by sugar daddying them but by giving them enough $$$ to get a good wage budget going and to sign some players. Let\\&amp;#039;s see what happens. :D Enjoy!\n\nImportant Note:\n\nUnzip to:\n\nMy Documents\\\\Sports Interactive\\\\Football Manager 2007\\\\db\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nUltimate_Red_Devil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0410726b5c56ae3317a1215a2d34d56deb2043","amp;dn":"EPL+MLS+%28Football+Manager+2007+Custom+db%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0410726b5c56ae3317a1215a2d34d56deb2043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,4,16,114,107,92,86,174,51,23,161,33,90,45,52,213,109,235,32,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
