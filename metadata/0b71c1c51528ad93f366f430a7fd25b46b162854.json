It is realization on a high level, a work done by a maestro with great science-fantasy and creativity. At times my works have been varied from but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t change anything because the pieces are still recognizable. My ideas have been realized not in a passive manner, but in an active manner which has recreated and re-invented what I have done previously for films. Many people have done versions of my pieces, but no one has done them like this.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ennio Morricone.\n\nBoasting an incredible all-star lineup of musical masters, The Big Gundown is THE landmark album that first introduced ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wild musical universe to a larger audience, influencing a whole new generation of creative musicians. Newly remastered, this 15th anniversary edition includes six remarkable bonus tracks recorded especially for this definitive edition now available exclusively from Tzadik. \n\nPersonnel:\nOrvin Aquart\nCyro Baptista\nJoey Baron\nTim Berne\nLaura Biscotto\nVicki Bodner\nPolly Bradfield\nGreg Cohen\nAnthony Coleman\nTrevor Dunn\nCarol Emanuel\nMark Feldman\nReinaldo Fernandes\nAnton Fier\nDuduca Fonseca\nErik Friedlander\nBill Frisell\nFred Frith\nDiamanda Galas\nMelvin Gibbs\nJody Harris\nMiho Hatori\nShelley Hirsch\nWayne Horvitz\nBob James\nGuy Klucevsek\nArto Lindsay\nChristian Marclay\nMark E.
