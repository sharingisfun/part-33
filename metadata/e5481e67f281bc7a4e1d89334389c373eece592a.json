It offers reliable protection from unforeseen data loss. All standard and professional functions are bundled up in one product. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the safest and easiest way to avoid losing important data! O&amp;O DiskImage lets you backup an entire computer or individual drives and files whenever you want Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even while the computerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being used. Never again will you have to worry about lost data: The backups you make can be restored with just a few clicks of the mouse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even if Windows is unable to start! O&amp;O DiskImage combines features for both the home user and the IT expert in one single product. A whole range of default and user-defined options lets you create the backup scenario that suits you best. A boot-medium containing additional system recovery tools will let you quickly restore important data -even when the images were created with older versions of the product.\n\nAutomated, as well as individual settings are possible. Thanks to the Start CD, which includes additional system rescue tools, you will quickly have all your important data available again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even, if Windows does not start up anymoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦O&amp;O DiskImage offers two alternatives to choose from when imaging data: a complete image or an incremental image. The complete image provides yet more flexibility with the offer of either a forensic image of the storage medium or an image of the used sectors only. With every image, including incremental images or split images, every piece of information in every image file is saved. This avoids a situation where images may be missed, whilst also maintaining a structural consistency throughout.\n\nPrevent data loss quickly and easily! With O&amp;O DiskImage, you have a high performance tool at your disposal for making professional images of entire computers or drives. After imaging, your old data is quickly available when problems with your computer arise.
