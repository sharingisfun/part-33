Her most recent film, 33 Days (2007), received a Special Tribute at the Al-Kasaba Film Festival, Ramallah.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc01f2b911dc9d9a13e917551b56fdbb723d5d8","amp;dn":"33+Days%5B2007%5D%5BDVDrip%5D%5B1800kbpsH264+192kbpsAC3%5D%5BFCN%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc01f2b911dc9d9a13e917551b56fdbb723d5d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,192,31,43,145,29,201,217,161,62,145,117,81,181,111,219,183,35,213,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
