Until she meets genetically enhanced soldier Adam Blacker. Team leader of a top-secret covert ops group, Adam never wanted to search for his genetic match, but whenever he gets close to Loren, things turn hot quickly, making him forget every reason he had for retaining his bachelor status. After a scorching night together, neither doubts they're connected at a DNA-deep level, although both fear the high stakes of what it means to be together.\n\nLoren gives Adam two weeks to prove he's bred for more than war. He must convince her that he's also coded for love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043ea22ffb1735d2b30c5be9b7151100ebc09a1f","amp;dn":"Lynne+Silver+-+Coded+for+Love+%28Books+1+-+4%29+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043ea22ffb1735d2b30c5be9b7151100ebc09a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,62,162,47,251,23,53,210,179,12,91,233,183,21,17,0,235,192,154,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
