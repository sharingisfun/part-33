What they lack in quantity, they more than make up for in the wide range of quality of material. The disc erupts with the progressive free-form &quot;A Hit by Varese&quot; -- which seems to have been inspired as much by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's Tarkus (1971) or Yes circa Close to the Edge (1972) as by the Parisian composer for whom it is named. Fully 80 percent of the material on Chicago V (1972) is also a spotlight for the prolific songwriting of Robert Lamm (keyboards/vocals). In addition to penning the opening rocker, he is also responsible for the easy and airy &quot;All Is Well,&quot; which is particularly notable for its lush Beach Boys-esque harmonies. However, Lamm's most memorable contributions are undoubtedly the Top Ten sunshine power pop anthem &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; and the equally upbeat and buoyant &quot;Dialogue, Pt. 1&quot; and &quot;Dialogue, Pt. 2.&quot; Those more accessible tracks are contrasted by James Pankow's (trombone/percussion) aggressive jazz fusion &quot;Now That You've Gone.&quot; Although somewhat dark and brooding, it recalls the bittersweet &quot;So Much to Say, So Much to Give&quot; and &quot;Anxiety's Moment&quot; movements of &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot; found on Chicago II.\n\nTerry Kath's (guitar/vocals) heartfelt ballad &quot;Alma Mater&quot; seems to be influenced by a Randy Newman sensibility. Lyrically, it could be interpreted as an open letter to his generation; lines such as &quot;Looking back a few short years/When we made our plans and played the cards/The way they fell/Clinging to our confidence/We stood on the threshold of the goal/That we knew, dear&quot; effectively recall the monumental world events that had taken place during the late '60s and early '70s. Likewise, there is an undeniable one-on-one intimated in the verse &quot;And though we had our fights/Had our short tempered nights/It couldn't pull our dreams apart/All our needs and all our wants/Drawn together in our heart/We felt it from the very start.&quot; This is a fitting way to conclude the album, if not the entire troubled era.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa7395e1f7848445ec3fcfcf90dbb929eaf4ea9","amp;dn":"Chicago+-+Chicago+V+%282014%29+%5BTeichiku+Records%5D+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa7395e1f7848445ec3fcfcf90dbb929eaf4ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,167,57,94,31,120,72,68,94,195,252,252,249,13,187,146,158,175,78,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
