Distribute software, provide real-time online help to end users, create detailed software and hardware reports, and automate routine management tasksâ€”all without leaving your desk. Featuring Automator actions and Remote Spotlight search, Apple Remote Desktop makes your job easier than ever.\r\n\r\nApple Remote Desktop is the award-winning OS X desktop management system for software distribution, asset management, and remote assistance. Apple Remote Desktop offers a wide range of high-performance features, including lightning-fast Spotlight searches across multiple systems; more than 40 Automator actions for easy automation of repetitive tasks; and AutoInstall for automatically updating software on mobile systems once they return to the network.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst-class upgrades\r\nInstalling software or updates to your network has never been this easy. Take an existing package, from either Apple or a third party, and simply use the Install Package to copy and install on your client computers. And it works with custom install packages as well. Apple Remote Desktop will alert your systemâ€™s users to upgrades and even restart machines remotely.\r\n\r\nAutoInstall allows you to stage software on a Task Server, which then takes care of distributing the packages for installation on client computers. You can even set a schedule for installation to occur at a time that is most convenient for your organization. And if a computer is not on the network, the Task Server will keep track and automatically install the package once the system is online.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomation for your Mac computers\r\nThose time-consuming administrative tasks will become a thing of the past, thanks to Automator actions in Apple Remote Desktop. To use Automator actions, all you need to do is drag and drop the actions to construct a workflow.\r\n\r\nMore than 40 Automator actions are included with Apple Remote Desktop, which you can apply to set desktop pictures, Finder preferences, Energy Saver preferences, default time zones, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo need to make house calls\r\nThe screen-sharing features of Apple Remote Desktop allow you to provide immediate help to remote users, saving time for both of you. Donâ€™t want your admin tasks to be seen? No problem. Turn on Curtain Mode to block the local userâ€™s view of their desktop. This is perfect when youâ€™re updating a public display. Youâ€™ll have full control of the system, but your work will be hidden from view.\r\n\r\nIf you need to move files or folders to a single computer, the easy-to-use Remote Drag and Drop copy function makes the job a snap. You can also copy and paste between local and remote systems â€” no extra steps necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting for duty\r\nRemote Spotlight search takes advantage of one of the most powerful features of OS X. Now you can perform lightning-fast, user-specified searches on remote client systems. Files from the results can be copied to the administrator system for reporting.\r\n\r\nApple Remote Desktop also makes it easy to compile reports on application usage, history, inventory, and more. Hardware reports gather more than 200 attributes about networked Mac systems, while software reports collect information on 16 file system attributes. Inventory reports can be gathered even from mobile systems not connected to the network, and results are stored in the included SQL database for fast access","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d447b0884e6879675d3fc5cdf490b5f0ecc68030","amp;dn":"Apple+Remote+Desktop+3.7.2+%2C+will+be+added+to+your+Apple+ID","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d447b0884e6879675d3fc5cdf490b5f0ecc68030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,71,176,136,78,104,121,103,93,63,197,205,244,144,181,240,236,198,128,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
