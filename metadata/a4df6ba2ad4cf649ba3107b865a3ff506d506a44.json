Cornered, Prince Regent JoÃƒÂ£o had\nto make the most fraught decision of his life. Protected by the British\nNavy, he fled to Brazil with his entire family, including his mentally\nill mother, most of the nobility, and the entire state apparatus.\nThousands made the voyage, but it was no luxury cruise. It took two\nmonths in cramped, decrepit ships. Sickness ran rampant. Lice infested\nsome of the vessels, and noble women had to shave their hair and grease\ntheir bald heads with antiseptic sulfur. Vermin infested the food, and\nbacteria contaminated the drinking water.\n\nNo European monarch had ever set foot in the Americas, let alone\nrelocating an entire court there. A week after landing, Prince JoÃƒÂ£o\nopened BrazilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ports, liberating the colony from a trade monopoly\nwith Portugal. While explorers mapped the burgeoning nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distant\nregions, the prince authorized the construction of roads, the founding\nof schools, and the creation of factories, raising Brazil to kingdom\nstatus in 1815. Meanwhile, under French control, Portugal was suffering\nthe dire effects of famine and war. Never had the country lost so many\npeople in so little time. But after NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fall and over a decade\nof misery, the Portuguese demanded the return of their king. JoÃƒÂ£o sailed\nback in tears, but because of him Brazil remained whole and powerful.\nAs he left, the last chapter of colonial Brazil drew to a close, setting\nthe stage for the strong, independent nation that we know today, changing\nthe history of the New World forever.\n\n1808: The Flight of the Emperor: How a Weak Prince, a Mad Queen,\nand the British Navy Tricked Napoleon and Changed the New World\nBy: Laurentino Gomes\nFormat: EPUB\nISBN: 9780762787968\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 645","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4df6ba2ad4cf649ba3107b865a3ff506d506a44","amp;dn":"1808+The+Flight+of+the+Emperor+by+Laurentino+Gomes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4df6ba2ad4cf649ba3107b865a3ff506d506a44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,223,107,162,173,76,246,73,186,49,7,184,101,163,255,80,109,80,106,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
