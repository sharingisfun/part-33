In each, Paul provided the stunning photography of interiors and exteriors, and Lee has written the historical background.\n\n*****\n\nMore photos than words, but very nice. It is divided into four sections: architecture, coutryards &amp; patios, Ironworks, and cemeteries. I wish it had been longer than the 112pp. And that it included some of the stunning Protestant churches of New Orleans. The bibliography lists just seven works! But a nicely packaged, well illustrated book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa39c182ca7cd4c603f0998b1f9bedffa0be7ca5","amp;dn":"The+Majesty+of+New+Orleans+%28Architecture+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa39c182ca7cd4c603f0998b1f9bedffa0be7ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,57,193,130,202,124,212,198,3,240,153,139,31,155,237,255,160,190,124,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
