A year later, having experimented with complex signals, we found an algorithm of signals that gave a stunning improvement in soundstage, transparency, details and dynamics for audio systems.\n\nThe reason behind this is that the small magnets in the signal-path become, with time, orientated in one direction. This produces a detrimental effect on the signal. The DeMagic signal actually relocates the magnets, and thereby breaks the magnetic field and it&amp;#039;s negative effect on the sound.\n\nIn 1997 the University of Seoul, Korea, carried out scientific tests that definitely proved the theory behind the DeMagic signal, and today the DeMagic is a must for any serious audiophile and music lover.[/i]\n\n\n\nRough review can be found here: http://www.densen.dk/DEMAGIC/TNT.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3932f2ff6c41c099d11b887729ef2ebd4ceaf49c","amp;dn":"Densen+DeMagic+%28signal+path+demagnetizer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3932f2ff6c41c099d11b887729ef2ebd4ceaf49c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,50,242,255,108,65,192,153,209,27,136,119,41,239,46,189,76,234,244,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
