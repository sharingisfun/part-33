However, it \nwas his dogged determination and epic battles with Niki Lauda \nwhich made him a Grand Prix Hero.\n\nGlorious archive footage shows us the great racer in action, \nwhile rare interviews remind us of the cheeky quips and \ntrademark broad grin. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dramatic racing film from his \ndebut at the 1973 Monaco Grand Prix right through to the \nFormula One World Championship-decided Japanese Grand Prix in \n1976, with narration throughout from Sir Stirling Moss.\n\nDespite a reputation which earned him the nickname Ã¢â‚¬ËœHunt the \nShuntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Lord Hesketh signed up the young Brit for an assault \non Formula One. We are treated to footage from that first \nyear, including HuntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s maiden podium at the Dutch Grand Prix, \nand action from 1974, when Hunt, with Harvey PostlethwaiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \nHesketh 308 at his disposal could manage only three podium \nfinishes. The 1975 season also proved tough for the team, but \nthe highlight came at Zandvoort when Hunt scored his first, \nand HeskethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only, Grand Prix win Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and archive footage lets \nus share the epic battle with Lauda.\n\nIn 1976 came a move to McLaren and one of the most fascinating \nand turbulent seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of Formula One racing. LaudaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ferrari \nled the way with a domination which would have broken the spirit \nof most contenders. Not Hunt. Neither was his ambition stifled \nby controversies such as disqualification from two GP wins or a \ngrid penalty Ã¢â‚¬ËœmistakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Hunt kept the pressure on and at the \nfinal race of the year he was just 3 points behind Lauda, still\ncarrying the scars of his horrific crash in Germany.\n\nSome say Hunt won his World Championship be default, due to \nLaudaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crash, but the spectacular and determined racing in this \nDVD shows he was a worthy winner, and a true Grand Prix Hero","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba85cfbe0a0af60a44570a6719a63650852b47c","amp;dn":"Grand+Prix+Heroes+-+James+Hunt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba85cfbe0a0af60a44570a6719a63650852b47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,168,92,251,224,160,175,96,164,69,112,166,113,154,99,101,8,82,180,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
