Personally, I find these VSTis a bit gimmicky and also they don&amp;#039;t encourage experimentation, as the user is pretty much limited to recreating construction kit mixes. A flashy interface is all well and good, but music producers want high quality samples they can use with any sequencer. Fortunately, the Electro ID VSTi allows hard disk rendering of individual samples. It took an awful long time for me to do this, but I&amp;#039;ve timestretched and RENDERED EVERY SINGLE SAMPLE FROm THE CD and renamed them appropriately. I&amp;#039;ve not included the pointless construction kit mix demos, but all the constituent parts are here.\nThe RAR files include 44KHz 16-bit files, all normalized and trimmed to loop correctly. Musical Key and tempo info is included in filenames where appropriate.\n\nHundreds of loops at 120bpm\n---------------------------\nBass drums, synth bass, drumloops, cymbals, Hi-hats, percussion, pads, SFX, Snares, Synths.\n\nHundreds of Oneshots\n--------------------\nBass drums, claps, cymbals, hi-hats, percussion, snares.\n\nFor producers of electro, techno and hard house, this sample pack is a sonic weapon.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n--\nArtyTorrent - Electrofied on 26 January 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc032c0269f52aff19db9ec2a5c613d5d11f4e7","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+30-Ueberschall+Electro+ID-WAV+Samples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fc032c0269f52aff19db9ec2a5c613d5d11f4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,192,50,192,38,159,82,175,241,157,185,236,42,92,97,61,93,17,244,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
