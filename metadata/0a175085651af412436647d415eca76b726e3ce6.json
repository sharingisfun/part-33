Once considered the failure of a legendary prophecy, Nariko must wield a sword that was ultimately meant for another. This ancient Heavenly Sword, once belonging to a powerful deity, can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly and inevitably killing them. For Nariko, it is a race against time to avenge her clan before her life is irreparably overtaken by the omnipotent Heavenly Sword.\n\nDirector: Gun Ho Jang\nWriter: Todd Farmer\nStars: Thomas Jane, Anna Torv, Alfred Molina\nGenres: Animation\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a175085651af412436647d415eca76b726e3ce6","amp;dn":"Heavenly.Sword.2014.HDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a175085651af412436647d415eca76b726e3ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,23,80,133,101,26,244,18,67,102,71,212,21,236,167,107,114,110,60,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
