In one field, ancient sea charts, it appears that accurate information has been passed down from people to people. It appears that the charts must have originated with a people unknown; that they were passed on, perhaps by the Minoans (the Sea Kings of ancient Crete) and the Phoenicians, who were for a thousand years and more the greatest sailors of the ancient world. We have evidence that they were collected and studied in the great library of Alexandria and that compilations of them were made by the geographers who worked there","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4c3a8f524ff9706db43b844a065766b4f1bd61","amp;dn":"Maps+of+the+Ancient+Sea+Kings+%28History+Travel%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4c3a8f524ff9706db43b844a065766b4f1bd61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,76,58,143,82,79,249,112,109,180,59,132,74,6,87,102,180,241,189,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
