Published by Avatar Press.\n\nGenre: Post-Apocalyptic/Horror\n\nCDisplayEx: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8689374\n\n\nDescription:\n\nWho are the crossed? Are they zombies? Are they people infected by some kind of virus? People plagued by infinite rage? We still don't know. But what we know is that they are extremely violent and you can't stop them with salt, unless you want to be dismembered or suffer a worse fate that involves more than your dignity.\n\nThe world is doomed and radioactive. The only survivors are a horde of murderous beasts and a small group of harmless survivors with almost no food and no weapons. Things couldn't be worse for humankind but Garth Ennis has always unpleasant surprises.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Crossed (#001-135) w/Specials | (Garth Ennis):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9349616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9349616&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music) - Lazerhawk - Skull and Shark (2013) [320 kpbs]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9284501&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9284501&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you any questions please make sure let me know on my most recent uploads ** \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eafa2f3e05e1c777272b3708ecefc7f823d151b","amp;dn":"Crossed+%28HD%29+%28%23000-009%29+%7C+%282008%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nahga-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eafa2f3e05e1c777272b3708ecefc7f823d151b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,175,162,243,224,94,28,119,114,114,179,112,142,206,252,127,130,61,21,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
