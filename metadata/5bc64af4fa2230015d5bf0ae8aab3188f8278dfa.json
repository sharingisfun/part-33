Dependent on factors such as their size and power, players will stumble but instantly recover if clipped.\n\n\n\nHeart: Defining what makes football so engrossing is difficult. Heart aims to recreate the effects of team support, both on an individual player basis and across the entire team.\n\n\n\nPES ID: PES 2013 set a new bar for realism, with its inclusion of the Player ID system. PES 2014 takes this even further with twice as many stars featuring bespoke animations and AI.\n\n\n\nThe Core: Visually PES 2014 will benefit from an incredible level of acuity, from the weave of the kits, through to facial movement, and a new animation process that offers slick segues from one move to the next, with no pauses or restrictions on control. Stadia will be faithful to real-life, with the entrances to the pitches recreated, crowds that move during the course of the game The new system also allows for a new light-mapping effect, adding a natural look to the proceedings. The flow of a match has also been improved, with tactical decisions made on the fly, and the removal of cut scenes after specific events.\n\n\nCrack v2 included\n1.install\n2.play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bc64af4fa2230015d5bf0ae8aab3188f8278dfa","amp;dn":"Pro+Evolution+Soccer+2014+-+Repack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bc64af4fa2230015d5bf0ae8aab3188f8278dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,198,74,244,250,34,48,1,93,91,240,174,138,171,49,136,248,39,141,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
