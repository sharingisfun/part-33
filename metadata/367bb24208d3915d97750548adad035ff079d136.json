Formed in late 2005 the band quickly became a vehicle through which itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s members were able to explore concepts and ideas through music. Intricate without being technical, grand in scope without the pretension, lush without losing intensity, the band forged ahead writing new material that at times teetered between the edges of progressive and hauntingly minimal. Armed with an array of guitar pedals, synth pads and thousands of audio samples Tunturia recorded their debut album in the summer of 2006 in an ambitious studio tour-de-force. The result is Maps, a 10 song album exploring the idea of various world regions traversing the globe both culturally and geographically. As ambitious as this record may seem, it marks only the first phase in the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ongoing evolution.\n\nWith the release of their debut album Maps, instrumental post-rock outfit Tunturia have been very busy. Headlining the first Son/Lumiere Music &amp; Arts showcase in Toronto and using the event as the auspicious occasion needed to launch the record, they soon embarked on a twelve date tour of Eastern Canada bringing their unique blend of atmospheric noise and deftly crafted melodies to a whole new audience. Striving to deliver more of an experience than a show, Tunturia has achieved what one listener described as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmusical stream of consciousnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ during their live performances.\n\nTunturiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound is distinct. The introspective melodies, lush compositions and nostalgic sounds of Maps has resonated with fans and critics alike, earning them favorable reviews from online webzines, forums and music blogs and culminating in the inclusion of one of their songs on The Silent BalletÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Compilation IV. This sudden influx of attention, some of it coming from as far as Japan, has caught the eye of various distributors thus enabling them to obtain a small deal to help promulgate the album on an international level.\n\nNot ones to rest on the accolades or achievements of the past, Tunturia are more anxious then ever to return to the studio and begin work on their follow-up record, the elaborately conceived and atmospherically complex Invisible City.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:367bb24208d3915d97750548adad035ff079d136","amp;dn":"Tunturia+-+Maps+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"367bb24208d3915d97750548adad035ff079d136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,123,178,66,8,211,145,93,151,117,5,72,173,173,3,95,240,121,209,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
