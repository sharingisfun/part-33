Wendy, Dorothy and Alice, three very different womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one jaded and old; one trapped in a frigid adulthood; the last a spunky but innocent young American good-time girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½provide each other with the liberation they need, while also providing very different (and, for this is a pornography, very sexual) versions of the stories we associate with them. We go with the girls, in memory, to the incidents that became the Rabbit Hole, Oz and Neverland. As a formal exercise in pure comics, Lost Girls is as good as anything Moore has written. (One of my favorite moments: a husband and wife trapped in a frozen, loveless, sexless relationship, conduct a stiff conversation, laced with unconscious puns and wordplay, moving into positions that cause their shadows to appear to copulate wildly, finding the physical passion that the people are denied.) In addition to being a master-class in comics technique, Lost Girls is also an education in Edwardian smutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Gebbie and Moore pastiche the pornography of the period, taking in everything from The Oyster to the Venus and Tannhauser period work of Aubrey BeardsleyMelinda Gebbie was a strange and inspired choice as collaborator for Moore. She draws real people, with none of the exaggerated bodies usual to superhero or porno comics. Gebbie's people, drawn for the most part in gentle crayons, have human bodies,.Lost Girls is a bittersweet, beautiful, exhaustive, problematic, occasionally exhausting work. It succeeded for me wonderfully as a true graphic novel. If it failed for me, it was as smut. The book, at least in large black-and-white photocopy form, was not a one-handed read. It was too heady and strange to appreciate or to experience on a visceral level. (Your mileage may vary; porn is, after all, personal.)Top Shelf has chosen to package it elegantly and expensively, presenting it to the world not as pornography, but as erotica. It is one of the tropes of pure pornography that events are without consequence. No babies, no STDs, no trauma, no memories best left unexamined. Lost Girls parts company from pure porn in precisely that place: it's all about consequences, not to mention war, music, love, lust, repression and memory.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.ca/Lost-Girls-Hardcover-Melinda-Gebbie/dp/1603090444&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.ca/Lost-Girls-Hardcover-Melinda-Gebbie/dp/1603090444&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74ff84020382c2296998bbf4446f797c0612789","amp;dn":"Alan+Moore+%26+Melinda+Gebbie+-+Lost+girls%2C+books+1%262+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74ff84020382c2296998bbf4446f797c0612789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,79,248,64,32,56,44,34,150,153,139,191,68,70,247,151,192,97,39,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
