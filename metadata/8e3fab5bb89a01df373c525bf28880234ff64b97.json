But Shadow Falls is facing a problem that could finally expose them to the rest of the world.  Humans are showing up dead, and rogue vampires may be to blame. \n\nCamp resident Della Tsang, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still coming into her own vampire powers, is assigned to help find those responsible. If she succeeds, maybe sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even land her dream job: working for the F.R.U., the enforcers of the supernatural world.  But when she sees that her new partner is a hunky shapeshifter, things get complicated.  Steve, too gorgeous to be trusted and capable of seeing through her tough-as-nails exterior, knows just how to get under her skin.  And only hours into the mission, Della realizes rogue vampires arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only threat sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s facing. If sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever going to complete her assignment, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need his helpÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but learning to trust him will be her hardest challenge yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3fab5bb89a01df373c525bf28880234ff64b97","amp;dn":"Saved+at+Sunrise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3fab5bb89a01df373c525bf28880234ff64b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,63,171,91,184,154,1,223,55,60,82,91,242,136,128,35,79,246,75,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
