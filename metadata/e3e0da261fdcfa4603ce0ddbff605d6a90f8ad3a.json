The first part presents some 25 proven recipes for the preparation of high-silica zeolites and describes the characteristics of the materials obtained. This will allow bench-scale production of these materials for scientific research. In the second part, high-silica zeolites with solved structure type are discussed. This part classifies many proprietary materials according to known structure types, and describes the rules and parameters which govern the formation of these materials. In the third part, the formation and characteristics of high-silica zeolites with unknown structure type are discussed. The book contains a wealth of information for all those scientists who incorporate the use of high-silica zeolites in their work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e0da261fdcfa4603ce0ddbff605d6a90f8ad3a","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1987%5D+Synthesis+of+High-Silica+Aluminosilicate+Zeolites+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e0da261fdcfa4603ce0ddbff605d6a90f8ad3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,224,218,38,31,220,250,70,3,206,13,219,255,96,93,106,144,248,173,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
