So far I like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28819179c22fb5858c30bf0726192aced962d8b","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+August+19%2C+2014+%5BALL-VERSIONS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28819179c22fb5858c30bf0726192aced962d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,136,25,23,156,34,251,88,88,195,11,240,114,97,146,172,237,150,45,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
