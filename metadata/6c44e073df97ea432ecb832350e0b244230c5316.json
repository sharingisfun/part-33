In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c44e073df97ea432ecb832350e0b244230c5316","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Paivepo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c44e073df97ea432ecb832350e0b244230c5316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,68,224,115,223,151,234,67,46,203,131,35,80,224,178,68,35,12,83,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
