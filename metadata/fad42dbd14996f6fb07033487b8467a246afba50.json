As a child, he witnessed the brutal rape and murder of his mother. The same man sexually molested Karl, leaving him for dead with horrific knife wounds covering his body. Years later, Karl has a chance to avenge his mothers murder by killing the man responsible. The opportunity arises on one unforgettable Good Friday night. For reasons he later regards as cowardice, Karl allows the opportunity to slip through his hands, only to be shattered when, two days later, two young girls are sexually molested and then brutally murdered by the killer on Easter Sunday morning. Karl now holds himself responsible for their deaths.\n\nThe Dark Place \nYoung homeless women and drug addicts are being abducted before being brutally mutilated and murdered, and a city is held in a grip of unspeakable terror. The cops are unable - or unwilling - to apprehend the elusive serial killer, and corrupt politicians turn a seemingly blind and almost approving eye to the catalogue of murders. The perpetrator is cunning, wealthy and influential. More importantly, he has never once made a mistake in his grisly calling - until now. By abducting Katie, the young daughter of legendary private investigator, Karl Kane, the killer has just made his first mistake, which could well turn out to be his last. Blaming himself for his daughter's abduction, Karl Kane must now reach down to the darkest recesses of his troubled soul and mind, to become as cunning and merciless as the killer - but even that may not be enough to penetrate the fortress-like lair where Karl suspects the killer keeps his victims. There is only one man capable of helping Kane attack the 'dark place', a man despised and hated by Detective Inspector Mark Wilson, but even that help becomes as elusive as any Karl will get from the cops. From the nail-biting beginning to the explosive ending, Karl Kane's nightmarish journey forces upon him a decision that changes his life forever, and forces him to look into the abyss of no return.\n\nDead of Winter \nPrivate Investigator Karl Kane returns to the streets of Belfast investigating the discovery of a severed hand. Karl believes itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the work of an elusive serial killer, but the police are claiming a simple vendetta between local criminals. Karl embarks on a nightmarish journey as he attempts to solve the mystery and soon heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suspecting Mark Wilson, his detested ex brother-in-law. But as the winter days become darker, Karl discovers that Wilson is more than a match for him when it comes to dirty dealing and even dirtier fighting, as he battles to keep from becoming the next victim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad42dbd14996f6fb07033487b8467a246afba50","amp;dn":"Sam+Millar+-+Karl+Kane+series+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad42dbd14996f6fb07033487b8467a246afba50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,212,45,189,20,153,111,111,176,112,51,72,123,132,103,162,70,175,186,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
