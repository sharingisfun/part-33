Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) is the \r\nhead of the LAPD and is loyal to his officers and eager to turn a blind eye \r\nto violence or corruption within his department, as long as it's the &quot;bad \r\nguys&quot; who are getting hurt. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a police detective \r\nwhose violent and cynical nature is often at war with his basic sense of \r\ndecency and justice. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is a beat cop-turned-detective \r\nwhose strict by-the-book philosophy and willingness to blow the whistle on \r\nother officers is balanced by a shrewd and opportunistic understanding of \r\nthe internal politics of the department. And Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) \r\nis a flashy &quot;Hollywood&quot; detective who serves as technical advisor for the \r\nTV series Badge of Honor. He is also in cahoots with Sid Hudgeons \r\n(Danny DeVito), publisher of the scandal sheet Hush Hush, who throws \r\nkickbacks to Vincennes in exchange for being brought along when showbiz \r\nfigures get busted. White, Exley, and Vincennes find themselves drawn \r\ninto a tangled and sticky web of violence and betrayal following a multiple \r\nmurder at a coffee shop that is believed to be part of an effort by Mickey \r\nCohen (Paul Guilfoyle) to consolidate his hold on organized crime in L.A. \r\nThis lead appears to be connected to the discovery of a bizarre pornography \r\nand call-girl ring operated by Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose \r\nwomen are given plastic surgery so that they more closely resemble well \r\nknown movie stars. White's role in the investigation is complicated when \r\nhe falls for Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), one of Patchett's prostitutes, \r\nwho is the spitting image of Veronica Lake. L.A. Confidential was nominated \r\nfor nine Academy Awards and netted two, with Brian Helgeland honored for \r\nBest Adapted Screenplay, and Kim Basinger taking home a statuette as Best \r\nSupporting Actress.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Kevin Spacey.\r\n=&gt;-Russell Crowe.\r\n=&gt;-Guy Pearce.\r\n=&gt;-Kim Basinger.\r\n=&gt;-Danny DeVito.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Curtis Hanson.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Drama : Mystery : Crime.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1997.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.93 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 007 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 17mn.\r\n=&gt;-L.A.
