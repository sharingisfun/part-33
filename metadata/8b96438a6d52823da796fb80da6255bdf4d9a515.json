She was constantly in search of a husband as well as a career in aviation. She eventually managed to get a job ferrying military equipment around the Pacific. Post-war, Sky Girl got a job as a waitress at an airport cafe and dyed her hair blond but still continued to have aerial adventures. She had no super powers, but she could fly a plane...just not very well. She often crashed planes and caused property damage.\n\n\nGolden Age Appearances  \nJumbo Comics #68-129\n\n\nSeed for all to enjoy!
