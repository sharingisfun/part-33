It was the first single released from their 4th album Sandinista!. The single was released in November 1980, in advance of the release of Sandinista!, with the anti-nuclear &quot;Stop the World&quot; as its B-side.\n\nThe song opens and closes with a US Marines' marching chant and is mostly about The Draft though it also deals war in general. The song also includes a rejection of dead-end jobs (&quot;who gives you work and why should you do it?&quot;). Though the US discontinued the draft in 1973, in 1980 Congress re-instated the requirement for men aged 18ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“25 to register with the Selective Service System. This may have inspired the song's subject matter as it was a topical subject in America during 1980, the year when Sandinista! was written and recorded.\n\nThe song was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York.\n\nDon Letts filmed the single's accompanying video in a warehouse owned by singer and collector of military paraphernalia Chris Farlowe. The video was in black and white, and featured the band dressed in costumes consisting of various parts of military uniforms and gear.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_Up&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_Up&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista!&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista!&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gABDAaaDe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gABDAaaDe&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video 768x576 25.00fps 4919kbps\n   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo stereo 164kbps\n   Duration: 00:05:07\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
