After installation make\nsure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer\nwindows are closed or else the file(s) will not copy over\nproperly (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into\nsafe mode if you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll and\nroboform-x64.dll (x64 dll is only needed for IE 64bit!) into AI\nRoboform's installed folder, making sure to overwrite the\nexisting files.  AI Roboform is now in the full PRO version with\nEnterprise features.\n\nIncluded is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you\ndon't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the\nPolicyEditor folder.\n\nFeel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when\nyou run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a\ntaskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known\nas RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.\nIn IE 64bit it may show as Desktop ONLY in the about window, but\nif you have chosen Everywhere syncing is still performed\n(hopefully fixed in an update).  Its suggested to use a different\nRoboForm Everywhere password than your master password.  This way\nnobody will be able to decrypt your online database except you.\n\nNote that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of\ninstallation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also\ntell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening\nthe About window from the taskbar icon, keep this running if you\nwant full time syncing with Everywhere.  Everywhere will show\nSync With [USERNAME], while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can\nbe changed at any time by going into Options then User Data and\nclicking on Settings button.\n\nThats it!  Enjoy.\n\nT E   2 0 1 2\n\nascii\nby mx\n\nDon't Hate The Hacker,  Hate The Code\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde1e324a6962469bf4087f171446a04d16c560b","amp;dn":"AI.Roboform.Enterprise.v7.7.2.0-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde1e324a6962469bf4087f171446a04d16c560b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,225,227,36,166,150,36,105,191,64,135,241,113,68,106,4,209,108,86,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
