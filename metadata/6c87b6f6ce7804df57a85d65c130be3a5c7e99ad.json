It covers matrix algebra, which provides a general means of formulating the details of a linear system. In addition, the author presents the basic theory of n-dimensional spaces and demonstrates its application to linear systems. Numerous problems appear throughout the text. 1963 edition.\n\n\nBy Lawrence P.
