It was released in the United States in December 1967 (Epic Records L2N 6071 (monaural) / B2N 171 (stereo)) and in the United Kingdom on April 16, 1968 (Pye Records NPL 20000 (monaural) / NSPL 20000 (stereo)). In December 1967, Epic Records also released each of the two records from A Gift from a Flower to a Garden as separate albums in the United States. The first record was released as Wear Your Love Like Heaven, and the second record was released as For Little Ones. This was done to allow budgeting for the double album package, which included a folder of the printed lyrics to the second disc with artwork, and a cover featuring an infrared photo of Donovan by Karl Ferris who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer (requiring six colour separations for printing, instead of the usual four separations). The back cover photo was also a shot taken by Ferris in LA during Donovan's and Karl's initiation into Transcendental Meditation, and depicted Donovan visiting with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\nContents http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gift_from_a_Flower_to_a_Garden\n\n   1. &quot;Wear Your Love Like Heaven&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n   2. &quot;Mad John's Escape&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:20\n   3. &quot;Skip-a-long Sam&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26\n   4. &quot;Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n   5. &quot;There Was a Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:02\n   6. &quot;Oh Gosh&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:48\n   7. &quot;Little Boy in Corduroy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n   8. &quot;Under the Greenwood Tree&quot; (words by William Shakespeare, music by Donovan Leitch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:58\n   9. &quot;The Land of Doesn't Have to Be&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n   10. &quot;Someone Singing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n   11. &quot;Song of the Naturalist's Wife&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:47\n   12. &quot;The Enchanted Gypsy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n   13. &quot;Voyage into the Golden Screen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n   14. &quot;Isle of Islay&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n   15. &quot;The Mandolin Man and His Secret&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n   16. &quot;Lay of the Last Tinker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:49\n   17. &quot;The Tinker and the Crab&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:55\n   18. &quot;Widow with Shawl (A Portrait)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n   19. &quot;The Lullaby of Spring&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n   20. &quot;The Magpie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:31\n   21. &quot;Starfish-on-the-Toast&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n   22. &quot;Epistle to Derroll&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:44\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2bcbc5227e7a3085469275dfffde5f0d3b276b9","amp;dn":"Donovan+-+1968+-+A+Gift+From+A+Flower+To+A+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2bcbc5227e7a3085469275dfffde5f0d3b276b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,188,188,82,39,231,163,8,84,105,39,93,255,253,229,240,211,178,118,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
