Stylistically, the album was a continuation of Rush's foray into the technology-oriented 1980s through increased use of electronic , sequencers Other noticeable changes were decreased song length and lyrical compression. The album reached #10 on the Billboard charts and was certified platinum by the RIAA in November 1982\nIn January 1982, in the Virgin Islands, Peart presented his lyrics for &quot;The Analog Kid&quot; to Lee and they both agreed that it would make a great up-tempo rocker. At Muskoka Lakes, Ontario in March at the Grange, &quot;Digital Man&quot; was put together and at Le Studio, along with the sequencer pattern with the guitar and bass.
