Big names like Ken, Azen, PC Chris, Korean DJ, and many others are all extensively featured across the lengthy film, and all have fascinating perspectives on the scene and its evolution.\n\nPlus, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a healthy dose of rivalry in just about every episode Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you know, to keep things interesting.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also learn about how Melee was never intended to be a competitive fighting game (but actually a party game), how the Smash community didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take wholeheartedly to Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the third iteration which released on the Nintendo Wii, and how Melee champions come and go in the blink of an eye. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Smash Brothers Kickstarter PageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nA glitch turns a popular party game into fierce competition overnight. The untold stories of the 7 greatest competitors of all time.\nI grew up playing video games, as many in my generation did. One of the most successful games was a very approachable one: a party game called Smash Brothers. You select a famous Nintendo character like Mario and duke it out with up to 3 friends. Most people just played for fun, but some played enough to discover a secret about the game - there were glitches. \nThe physics engine allowed players to exploit artifacts which sped the game into a fast-paced, high pressure fighting game. The best were the eccentric ones, the shy ones, the aggressively dominant and the mind-bendingly strategic. \nThese teenagers suddenly found themselves fighting for thousands of dollars under harsh pressure and dealt with tragedy and adversity on the way. The emotional journey from noob to pro left some jaded, some rich and others on a new track to find meaning in their adult lives.\nIn this 9-part series, we want to tell these untold stories. Those of the Smash Brothers.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/paee5z223/vlcsnap_00002.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/paee5z223/vlcsnap_00002.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/5tloxif73/vlcsnap_00005.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/5tloxif73/vlcsnap_00005.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s21.postimg.org/qm5uw26dj/vlcsnap_00006.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s21.postimg.org/qm5uw26dj/vlcsnap_00006.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/ypgmillot/vlcsnap_00007.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/ypgmillot/vlcsnap_00007.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/4jnviglf3/vlcsnap_00008.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s17.postimg.org/4jnviglf3/vlcsnap_00008.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\n * Framerate: 23 fps \n * Audio Quality: 44KHz (~253Kbps)\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 4h 18mn 9sec\n * Number of Parts: 9\n * Part Size:494-983 Mb\n * Container: MP4\n * Released: 2013\n * Source: WebDL (From Thanks to\n * Downloader: ClipConverter\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\nFurther Information \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://smashboards.com/threads/the-smash-brothers-series-discussion.341152/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://smashboards.com/threads/the-smash-brothers-series-discussion.341152/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSource:\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0392ed33368e53fec4e0a962551b8f33079b9093","amp;dn":"The+Smash+Brothers+%289+Part+Series%29+Pre+Remastered+WEBRIP+%7Eskynet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0392ed33368e53fec4e0a962551b8f33079b9093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,146,237,51,54,142,83,254,196,224,169,98,85,27,143,51,7,155,144,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
