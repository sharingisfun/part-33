Having heard this album, Im positive we do. \n\nWolverine records released this album.  As you may or may not know, Wolverine is a small german label for punk, hardcore, garage, ska etc. No surprise this album kinda flew under the radar I suppose. If you like your country industrial with a twist of punk and harcore rockabilly this is the album for you. \nIf you reckognice any of the bands involved with this you know you are in for a treat. Musically the contributions here range from folk to country to rockabilly, punk to psychobilly, and industrial to americana.\n\n\n192kbps\n\n01 Dale Watson - Guess things happen that way\n02 The ScotchGreens - There you go\n03 Supersuckers - Mean-eyed cat\n04 Stevie Tombstone - Folsom Prison blues\n05 Deadbolt - Orange blossom special\n06 Beverly Killbillies - Wanted man\n07 Kings Of Nuthin' - Cry, cry, cry\n08 Flametrick Subs - Dirty old egg-suckin' dog\n09 Bastard Sons Of Johnny Cash - Long black veil\n10 Jesse Dayton - Doin' my time\n11 Concombre Zombi - Flesh &amp; blood\n12 12 Step Rebels - Delia's gone\n13 Satan's Teardrops - I got stripes\n14 Los Creepers - Wreck of the old '97\n15 Eddie Spaghetti - Peace in the valley\n16 Todd Stedman - Hey porter\n17 Speedbuggy USA - Drive on\n18 Hot Rod Lincoln - I walk the line\n19 South Austin Allstars - The man in black","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3bc10439b9949ed2cf29cd618dc4f24be08cfe8","amp;dn":"VA+-+Dear+Johnny+-+A+Tribute+To+Cash+%28Punk.Hardcore.Rockabilly.A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3bc10439b9949ed2cf29cd618dc4f24be08cfe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,188,16,67,155,153,73,237,44,242,156,214,24,220,79,36,190,8,207,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
