To Edwin, the mahr is a constant source of consternation and annoyance, and he would like nothing more than for it to disappear forever. But to those who hunt him, the mahr is more than it appears, and they will do whatever it takes to have it. \n\nBut Edwin isn't the only one in his village with secrets. His best friend, Walt, has a few that will change the life of every person Edwin has ever known. Walt is the key to unlocking Edwin's own great destiny... if Edwin can survive the encounter.
