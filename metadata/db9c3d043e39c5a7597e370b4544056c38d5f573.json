Essentials of Understanding Psychology is written around the philosophy that an effective textbook must be oriented to students: informing them, engaging them, exciting them about the field, and expanding their intellectual capabilities because when students understand psychology, they learn psychology. No matter what brings students into the introductory course and regardless of their initial motivation, Essentials of Understanding Psychology, Seventh Edition, draws students into the field and stimulates their thinking. This revision integrates a variety of elements that foster students&amp;#039; understanding of psychology and its impact on their everyday lives. It also provides instructors with a fully integrated supplements package to objectively gauge their students&amp;#039; mastery of psychology&amp;#039;s key principles and concepts and to create dynamic lectures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my first torrent, I am currently in college and I am fed up with paying for books, I am even more fed up with buying an e-book and only getting 20 dollars off and not being able to do what I want with said e-book. No one wants to use adobe&amp;#039;s shitty digital edition .pdf reader. I say FUCK THAT SHIT!!!!!!!! \n\n\nNote: This was an ebook with all the drm stripped off","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9c3d043e39c5a7597e370b4544056c38d5f573","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Understanding+Psychology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9c3d043e39c5a7597e370b4544056c38d5f573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,156,61,4,62,57,197,167,89,126,55,11,69,68,5,108,56,213,245,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
