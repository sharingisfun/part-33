Since then, the Levellers have achieved enough grassroots success in their homeland to support their very own festival, and album number ten, Truth &amp; Lies, finds the Brighton, England, sextet in a familiar place. Big rousing choruses, manic fiddling, and heartfelt anthems aim for the stadium walls with surprising effectiveness, displaying either a newfound vitality or an amiable acceptance that what their fans want, their fans will get. Opener &quot;Last Man Alive&quot; flirts with Green Day-esque melodic punk, &quot;Confess&quot; revisits the Manchester-style, fiddle- and loop-based structure that made classics like &quot;The Boatman&quot; so addictive, and the spacious and grand &quot;Sleeping&quot; serves as a fitting end, channeling Mike Scott's &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; and Miles Hunt's &quot;Sing the Absurd&quot; with both reverence and frivolity. Truth and Lies breaks little ground for the veteran band, but it's as good as anything they've ever put out, and a little more self-assured. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bda8abc139356fba35ff147e1a3a71add9418145","amp;dn":"The+Levellers...Truth+%26amp%3B+Lies%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bda8abc139356fba35ff147e1a3a71add9418145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,168,171,193,57,53,111,186,53,255,20,126,26,58,113,173,217,65,129,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
