But, given the destructive forces of the fast-food industry and factory farming, we need to make smart, informed choices about the food we eat and where it comes from. In 50 short chapters, Martins cuts through organize zealotry and the misleading jargon of food labeling to outline realistic steps everyone can take to be part of the sustainable-food movement. With wit, and insight, and no small amount of provocation, THE CARNIVORE'S MANIFESTO is both a revolutionary call to arms and a rollicking good read that will inspire, engage, and challenge anyone interested in the way we eat today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fee38a254ba7121723421c02787c22351c8dbcd","amp;dn":"The+Carnivore%27s+Manifesto+by+Patrick+Martins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fee38a254ba7121723421c02787c22351c8dbcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,238,56,162,84,186,113,33,114,52,33,192,39,135,194,35,81,200,219,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
