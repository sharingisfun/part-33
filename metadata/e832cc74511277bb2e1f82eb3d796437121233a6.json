They're what I suppose you'd call a minimal synth band, pretty heavy on noise. Some of the noisier tracks might lead you to believe that your speakers or headphone is broken. And they might be.\n\nTwo of the songs are covers and you might love them, but you'll probably hate them. They seem strangely out of place with their listless female lead vocals and if you take them out of the equation, you'll find the rest of this EP a rather catchy, quirky gem from the obscura of the 80's.\n\nA1 N.F.A. 2:14\nA2 Dancing In The Street 5:11\t\nA3 So Hard 2:23\nB1 Don't Worry 2:29\nB2 Immune To You 2:13\nB3 She Loves You 2:23\t\n\nEngineer - Gregory Jones\nGuitar, Bass, Vocals - Jon Velcro\nPercussion, Vocals, Keyboards, Synthesizer, Guitar - Rad Solar\nProducer - Roy Sablosky\nVocals - Colleen Hinks\nVocals, Percussion, Guitar - Gene Gabriel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e832cc74511277bb2e1f82eb3d796437121233a6","amp;dn":"Standard+Of+Living+-+Six+Songs+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e832cc74511277bb2e1f82eb3d796437121233a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,50,204,116,81,18,119,187,46,31,130,235,61,121,100,55,18,18,51,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
