This episode is no longer for sale and has been discontinued on the New Yankee Workshop website.  So I guess it is now obsolete.  I am beginning to think that maybe Norm didn&amp;#039;t like his 1999 season.  However, as usual, Norm produces one good show.  It is in avi format, from a british source. If you like it, be sure to buy other tapes/dvd/plans from newyankee.com \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e8f6fe99132f28a63f9533bd496d6a5f24c3c8c","amp;dn":"New+Yankee+Workshop+-+1999+Season+Episode+7+-+Bake+Center","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e8f6fe99132f28a63f9533bd496d6a5f24c3c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,143,111,233,145,50,242,138,99,249,83,59,212,150,214,165,242,76,60,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
