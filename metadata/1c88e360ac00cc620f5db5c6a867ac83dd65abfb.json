I saw them in concert at the El Mocambo (Toronto) recently (i.e., tonight), and they claim they are from Chicago.  However, after reading a bit about them, they&amp;#039;re actually from all over the place.\n\nThe band itself has had different reincarnations, having different members over time.   I have no idea what they sounded like before, so I can only speak for what they sound like now.  I suppose their sound would go under &quot;indie rock -slash - experimental&quot;, whatever that means!\n\nThe band consists of 7 members, which includes a drummer, a female vocalist, and base  guitar player, and three other band members who alternate instruments which ranges from an electric piano, drums, horns, all sorts of percussion instruments, xylophone, and electric guitar.\n\nJust check out their myspace page to find out more.\n\nI have to admit, I prefer listening to them live, but here&amp;#039;s a sampling anyway.  Let me know what you think.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c88e360ac00cc620f5db5c6a867ac83dd65abfb","amp;dn":"Anathallo+-+Floating+World+%282006%29+%5BMP3+192kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c88e360ac00cc620f5db5c6a867ac83dd65abfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,136,227,96,172,0,204,98,15,93,181,198,168,103,172,131,221,101,171,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
