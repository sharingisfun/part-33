First attracted to the piano by his mother, also a by-ear player, and early Liberace recordings, his musical influences are vastly varied, from musical theatre, opera, pure jazz and classical to swing, Latin, pop and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s British soul: Dusty Springfield, Cilla Black, Petula Clark (with whom he shares the strange accolade of having first performed in the foyer of Bentalls department store in London). In 2009, The Stage newspaper described his voice Ã¢â‚¬Å“as smooth as BublÃƒÂ©, yet defiant like early Streisand.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBut as you might expect, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s JamsheedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s piano playing that really drives this album. With the exception of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSome Sunday MorningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which is solely percussion and voice, the piano has the most to say. Drifting between the jazz and show-tune camps, Ã¢â‚¬ËœHushabye MountainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a cleverly orchestrated surprise and contrasts steeply with the honest simplicity of the instantly recognisable Ã¢â‚¬ËœMistyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Then like a gust of fresh air,Ã‚Â  Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Trolley SongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pounds you with the stuff that love at first sight is made of.\n\nPenned by Jamsheed on a grey afternoon on an English beach, the song that gives the album its name presents a blissfully domestic picture of comfortable, old fashioned love, a topic long overlooked by songwriters. Finally the voice gives way to a rich piano and full orchestra interpretation of the best known melody of the last century, Ã¢â‚¬ËœComme dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢habitudeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perhaps better known as Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy Way.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nPerformed and produced single handed by Jamsheed Master, YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Never Know finds shelf space somewhere between jazz and musicals and maintains a strong musicality and an unabashed self-awareness throughout, making his music popular with a wide range of audiences: A collection of honestly self-aware songs that each tell their own story.\n\nTrack list:\n\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  1 Old School Lover Boy\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  2 The Way You Look Tonight\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  3 Some Sunday Morning\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  4 Embraceable You\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  5 Hushabye Mountain\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  6 Misty\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  7 The Trolley Song\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  8 You'd Never Know\nÃ‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â  9 Comme d'habitude","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68d5444d2d1aab4da7098b1ac362891e29cd36bb","amp;dn":"Jamsheed+Master+-+You%27d+Never+Know+%282008%29.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68d5444d2d1aab4da7098b1ac362891e29cd36bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,213,68,77,45,26,171,77,167,9,139,26,195,98,137,30,41,205,54,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
