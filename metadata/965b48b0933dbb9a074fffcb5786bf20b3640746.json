You will have to ensure that they have a constant supply of oxygen, food and water to stay alive.\r\n\r\nYou will get them to collect energy, extract water, mine metal, grow food, manufacture bots, and build a fully self-sufficient base.\r\n\r\nEven if the game is not intended to be a simulator, all the mechanics are plausible, and based on what the expected challenges of establishing a colony in an new planet would be.\r\n\r\nPatch Notes:\r\nThis version adds quite an important change in behavior for the AI: \r\nNow, when out of Spares, Metal and Bioplastic will be sent to the Spares Workshop even if there are buildings pending construction. This will make it much easier to build new structures, without running out of spares in the process.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows Vista/7/8/10\r\nProcessor: 2 GHz Dual Core\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: 512 MB VRAM (Shader Model 3)\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\r\nHard Drive: 550 MB available space \r\n\r\nRecommended:\r\nOS: Windows 7/8/10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: AMD/NVIDIA card\r\nDirectX: Version 11\r\nHard Drive: 550 MB available space \r\n- Many bug fixes\r\n\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen 'Planetbase v1.1.1.exe' , wait for a bit for the self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the game folder, open the extracted folder and play.....\r\nOR\r\nExtarct it yourself using 'WinRAR'\r\n\r\nAlways open the game using run as administrator\r\n\r\nCheck my FB page for more :\r\nMr DJ repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:965b48b0933dbb9a074fffcb5786bf20b3640746","amp;dn":"Planetbase+version+1.1.1+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"965b48b0933dbb9a074fffcb5786bf20b3640746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,91,72,176,147,61,187,154,7,79,255,203,87,134,191,32,179,100,7,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
