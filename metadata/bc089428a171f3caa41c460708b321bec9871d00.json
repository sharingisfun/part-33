It was written at the instance of Swami Anand. It appeared in the Weekly Ã¢â‚¬ËœNavjivanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ during 1925-28. It covers GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life up to 1920. He did not cover the period after that as it was well known to the people and most of the concerned persons were alive. Besides he felt that his experiments in that period were yet to yield definite conclusions.\n\nGandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s autobiography is very different from other autobiographies. The autobiographies normally contain self-praise by the authors. They want to criticize their opponents and boost their own image in the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s autobiography is completely free from all this. It is marked with humility and truthfulness. He had not hidden anything. In fact, he is rather too harsh on himself. He did not want to show to the world how good he was. He only wanted to tell the people the story of his experiments with Truth.\n\nTruth, for Gandhi, was the supreme principle, which includes many other principles. Realization of the Truth is the purpose of human life. Gandhi always strove to realize the Truth. He continuously tried to remove impurities in himself. He always tried to stick to the Truth as he knew and to apply the knowledge of the Truth to everyday life. He tried to apply the spiritual principles to the practical situations. He did it in the scientific spirit. Sticking to the truth means Satyagraha. Gandhi therefore called his experiments as Ã¢â‚¬ËœExperiments with TruthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœExperiments in the science of Satyagraha.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Gandhi also requested the readers to treat those experiments as illustrative and to carry out their own experiments in that light.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc089428a171f3caa41c460708b321bec9871d00","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+My+Experiments+with+Truth+-+An+Autobiography+-+Moha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc089428a171f3caa41c460708b321bec9871d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,8,148,40,161,113,243,202,164,28,70,7,8,179,33,190,201,135,29,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
