The BBFC later passed the film completely uncut in 2005 with the following comment, &quot;The content of the film is in fact very mild and poorly executed. If anything, it was the title of the film and its original packaging that led to difficulties, rather than the content. The idea of the film may, of course, be offensive to some but that is not a good enough reason to cut or reject it. We would only cut or reject a film for adults if the content was illegal or harmful. &quot;SS Experiment Camp&quot; is neither illegal or harmful, just tasteless.&quot; It was eventually released in 2006 with different artwork.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5a467c9ebe84ccd24a2731d2a07277e7ca70e52","amp;dn":"SS+Experiment+Love+Camp+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5a467c9ebe84ccd24a2731d2a07277e7ca70e52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,164,103,201,235,232,76,205,36,162,115,29,42,7,39,126,124,167,14,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
