Over ten months, we follow the mad Artaud from his cruel coaching of an actress in his &quot;theatre of cruelty&quot; to his semi-friendship with Prevel who buys him drugs and hangs on his every word. Meanwhile, Prevel divides his time between Jany, his blond, young, drug-hazed mistress, and Rolande, his dark-haired, long-suffering wife, who has a child during this time. Cruelty, neglect, poverty, egoism, madness, and the pursuit of art mix on the Left Bank.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d934700710ccf5c5e0eb9722feefdc7355d055cb","amp;dn":"Gerard+Mordillat+-+En+compagnie+d%27Antonin+Artaud+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d934700710ccf5c5e0eb9722feefdc7355d055cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,52,112,7,16,204,245,197,224,235,151,34,254,239,220,115,85,208,85,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
