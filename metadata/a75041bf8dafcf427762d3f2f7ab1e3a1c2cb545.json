Applewhite are back, in this middle-grade sequel to Stephanie S. TolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Newbery Honor Book Surviving the Applewhites.\n\nTeenager E.D., the not so artistic, not at all eccentric member of the unconventional Applewhite clan, can't believe the plan her father has hatched to save the family from financial disaster. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decided to transform their rural North Carolina farm into a summer camp for creative children.\n\nSoon the farm is packed with temperamental artists, out-of-control campers, and an even more out-of-control goat. It's all a little too much for structure-loving E.D., even before threatening notes begin appearing in the family mailbox. Together with Jake Semple--the boy who survived his first year in the Applewhites' home schoolÃ¢â‚¬â€she's determined to save the camp and the family from disaster.\n\nLike Carl HiassanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chomp, Applewhites at Wit's End combines outrageous humor and the frustrations and joys of being part of a family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a75041bf8dafcf427762d3f2f7ab1e3a1c2cb545","amp;dn":"Applewhites+at+Wit%27s+End+-+Stephanie+S.+Tolan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a75041bf8dafcf427762d3f2f7ab1e3a1c2cb545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,80,65,191,141,175,207,66,119,98,211,242,247,171,30,58,28,44,181,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
