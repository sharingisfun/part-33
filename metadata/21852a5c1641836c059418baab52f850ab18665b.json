But they are, U-fit DOES exist, as do John and Ann Armstrong, Basil Meanie, and the U-fit &quot;sales&quot; force.\n\nFive minutes into this new docusoap about a conservatory firm, [this reviewer] had to stop writing down priceless quotes - there were just too many. They come tumbling from the mouths of John and Ann Armstrong, the husband-and-wife business team who are its stars. The idea is a kind of all-too-reallife version of The Office set in Coventry. Ann is the more talkative of the two, a mixture of starry-eyed optimist and petty disciplinarian. John mostly just swears a lot and criticises Ann's schemes for improving the company - such as hiring a Zimbabwean\nmotivational guru called Basil. It's well edited, brilliantly filmed and shamefully entertaining. And there are another seven episodes to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21852a5c1641836c059418baab52f850ab18665b","amp;dn":"The+Armstrongs+%282006%29+UK+Tv+series+Ep1%28Rare%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21852a5c1641836c059418baab52f850ab18665b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,133,42,92,22,65,131,108,5,148,24,186,171,82,248,80,171,24,102,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
