Her father, a now-incarcerated Drug Lord, has kept her under his thumb her whole life, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned enough from living in his world to give everyone the cold shoulder. But one inebriated night, she shows Hector the Real Sadie, and he knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll stop at nothing to have her. Hector Chavez makes one (huge) mistake: he waits for Sadie to come to him. Tragedy strikes, and SadieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a choice. She can retreat behind her Ice Fortress, or she can embrace the Rock Chick/Hot Bunch World. Guided by Hector, the Rock Chicks, the Hot Bunch and her new gay roommates, Buddy and Ralphie, Sadie negotiates a life out from under her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thumb. A life that includes poison, arson and learning how to make sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢mores.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acdb7638a6426640d6190042f59207ebe29ec5b8","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-+Rock+Chick+07+-+Rock+Chick+Regret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acdb7638a6426640d6190042f59207ebe29ec5b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,219,118,56,166,66,102,64,214,25,0,66,245,146,7,235,226,158,197,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
