But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec, stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in New York City.\n\nStars: Keira Knightley, Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine\n\n\nTrailer and Clip  \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc5b302b43d97ef4c5c137e2b85d4f9fcfcdbc8","amp;dn":"Begin.Again.2013.BDrip.1080p.x264-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc5b302b43d97ef4c5c137e2b85d4f9fcfcdbc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,197,179,2,180,61,151,239,76,92,19,126,43,133,212,249,252,252,219,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
