But sometimes, one can get bogged down in the minutia of times gone by and \nfail to grasp the significance of the bigger picture. This volume from historian James Johonnot is the antidote to overly compartmentalized history texts, \noffering a broad perspective on the major events that coalesced to shape the world we live in.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7139b600ef6283118f7d58622cbee51de252c51e","amp;dn":"Ten+Great+Events+in+History+%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7139b600ef6283118f7d58622cbee51de252c51e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,57,182,0,239,98,131,17,143,125,88,98,44,190,229,29,226,82,197,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
