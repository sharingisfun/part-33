The Belgian band was formed in 2009 by the young and talented vocalist Jamie-Lee Smith (ex-Skeptical Minds, ex-Aedden) and the keyboardist Vlad. Now, in early 2011, they came with the very first and promising mini-album, Ã‚Â«ThanatosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ InsanityÃ‚Â».\n\nAzylya, in this first mini-album, shows a very great potential and professionalism. With just 2 years of existence, the band seems to have the power of create melodic metal catchy melodies that at the same time can be classified by sweet and heavy.\n\nCombining charismatic female vocals and piano with thrash male vocals Azylya creates a unique sound and makes sure that every melody will stay in the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head. Those compositions are, for sure, incredibly consistent for a so young band.\n\nAnother good mark on this mini-album were the keyboards by Vlad, influenced by soundtracks creating that way a gloomy atmosphere that often precedes heavy guitar riffs and revolting female vocals, a good example of those influences is the 2nd track Ã‚Â«The IncestÃ‚Â».\n\nÃ‚Â«The Beginning Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã‚Â», the intro, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a journey through horror and pain. With sounds that also remain childhood, this intro brings the listener to tenderness infancy. Impressing for its deep side.\n\nOn this mini-album, the band came across with many influences from Ã‚Â« Beauty and the Beast Ã‚Â» theme. On most of the songs Jamie and Vlad sing in opposition, what in Azylya creates a really good sound. Songs like Ã‚Â«The IncestÃ‚Â», Ã‚Â«WoodscapeÃ‚Â» and Ã‚Â«AzylyaÃ‚Â» show that use this theme doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refers only to do mediocre metal and compositions without originality. Especially with the keyboards, that not using the common Ã‚Â« power metal Ã‚Â» mood on female-fronted metal but a &quot;soundtrack&quot; mood thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more surprising to the genre and without doubt a good choice!\n\nÃ‚Â«WoodscapeÃ‚Â» is without hesitation the catchiest track on Ã‚Â«ThanatosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ InsanityÃ‚Â» mini-album. Starting with a sweet piano and charming female vocals, it quickly changes to a heavy melody that stays in your head once again with the opposition of female/male vocals present.\n\nÃ‚Â«DeliriusÃ‚Â» is the only song on the mini-album where Jamie sings alone, giving to it a different atmosphere. Less heavy but even that way not a Ã¢â‚¬Å“balladÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or slow song. Emotion is present and despair is the feeling that jumps to hears more easily, once again Azylya shows an incredible talent for a new band!\n\nThe vocalists, along the record, show a very great compatibility that gave quality to the mini-album. Jamie Lee with her pleasant vocals, impressive for someone with just 17 years old but that has a lot of experience, contrarily to most of the singers of her age and Vlad with aggressive vocals that gave the necessary emotion to the heaviest parts.\n\nAnother positive point on Ã‚Â«ThanatosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ InsanityÃ‚Â» was the good production, that even not being impressive is pretty good for the first studio work of a small and new band. The mini-album is really listenable and has a good sound quality!\n\nIn general, Ã‚Â«ThanatosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ InsanityÃ‚Â» and Azylya are a surprise in various points: vocals, composition and production! So probably Azylya will be a name that we will hear in near future! Just more variety is needed, but we look forward to the first album because the mini-album promise us a lot!\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n1.
