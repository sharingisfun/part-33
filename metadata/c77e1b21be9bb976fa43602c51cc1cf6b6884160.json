Moving elegantly through a bromide of dub, reverb and irradiated swathes of strings and keyboards, creamy-sweet vocalist Ricky Barrow sings downbeat songs wallowing in sleaze and self loathing. &quot;One Night Stand&quot; is a sordid lament on the part of a serial stud at his inability to care for women; &quot;Stuck On The Shelf&quot;'s chorus of &quot;Come on over here and have some fun&quot; sounds about as healthy as that of a loiterer in a dirty mac outside a school playground; while &quot;Abuse&quot; is a chronicle of body-poisoning bad habits. Yet all of this negativity is couched in some of the most uplifting and expansive dance rhythms of the 1990s. --David Stubbs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c77e1b21be9bb976fa43602c51cc1cf6b6884160","amp;dn":"The+Aloof+-+Sinking+%5B1996%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c77e1b21be9bb976fa43602c51cc1cf6b6884160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,126,27,33,190,155,185,118,250,67,96,44,81,204,28,246,182,136,65,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
