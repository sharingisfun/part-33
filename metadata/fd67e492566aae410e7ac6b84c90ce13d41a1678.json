It starts off slow, but you'll recognize the tunes almost right off the bat, I firmly believe.\nEven if you've never played the original games, most of these songs are among the most remixed songs out there.\nYou are bound to have heard it somewhere along the line.\n\n  This album could not be found anywhere in FLAC before I bought this. I looked before buying.\nI hope you enjoy this as much as I have. It is also available at the FFShrine forums via Filesonic and\n\n  Please buy this album if you love it! http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=QWCE-133\nI used to pirate music day in, day out. Now, nothing feels as good as having an official CD in your hands, let alone one you love!\n\n\n[== Notes ==]\n\nAll tracks are tagged from original CD, and VGMDB (Japanese version).\n\n\nSome of the tags are tagged incorrectly. I apologize.\n\nTrack 17 was actually Mother 2. VGMDB was right. Someone from Youtube screwed up.\n\nIt is unknown if track 18 was written by Mari Iijima.\n\nThe albumart.pamp file is a cached image for PowerAMP media player on Android.
