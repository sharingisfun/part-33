This program stands between your browser and the Internet, redirecting all requests for web pages to the proxy servers and making you anonymous to the websites you are visiting.\n\nIt can also be used for other purposes. Webmasters can check how their websites look from other countries and how fast they load; system administrators can see if their servers are available from the outside of the corporate network. Anybody can avoid network congestions by using a proxy - you can quickly choose the fastest route to any site with the Check URL feature. Non-anonymous proxies are supported as well, so if all you want is a convenient manager of proxy servers, this is your choice.\n\nAdded in the latest version:\n\n* Long-awaited export feature allows you to use the proxies in other programs and share them with your friends. You can export all proxies, only good ones, or just the ones you select.\n\n* Enhanced proxy import engine. Now you can import proxies automatically from local files, local folders (i.e., by telling the program to import all files located in a particular folder), or directly from the web (just give the program the URL of the page with a proxy list). In the latter case, A4Proxy downloads the page anonymously, using the same proxy settings you selected for surfing. \nMajor benefits of the new version of Anonymity 4 Proxy:\n\n*Visit any websites in the world without having to tell them who you are and where  you live\n\n*Optionally modify the operating system and other technical information sent out by your browser\n\n*Confuse the websites further by sending them a fake IP address along with your requests\n\n*Download files with programs like GetRight and other download managers staying anonymous to the sites from which you download\n\n*If you are a webmaster, submit multiple webpages to search engines without having to worry about submission limits - submit each page using a different anonymous proxy!\n \n*Learn more about the inside of the Internet and how it works\n\n*Thoroughly check the anonymity status of proxy servers and their performance\n\n*Choose to use only those proxies that meet particular anonymity requirements\n\n*A4Proxy supports HTTP (websites), Secure HTTP (HTTPS, SSL - secure websites) and \n\n\n\nFTP protocols.\n\n* Interface in English, German, Italian, Spanish and other languages...\n\n* Use a different anonymous proxy server for each request\n\n* Block cookies, and selectively modify any information sent out by your browser.
