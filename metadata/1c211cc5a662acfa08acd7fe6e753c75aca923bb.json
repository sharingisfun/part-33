Silicon Alley is a ghost town, Web 1.0 is having adolescent angst, Google has yet to IPO, Microsoft is still considered the Evil Empire. There may not be quite as much money around as there was at the height of the tech bubble, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no shortage of swindlers looking to grab a piece of whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left.\n\nMaxine Tarnow is running a nice little fraud investigation business on the Upper West Side, chasing down different kinds of small-scale con artists. She used to be legally certified but her license got pulled a while back, which has actually turned out to be a blessing because now she can follow her own code of ethicsÃ¢â‚¬â€carry a Beretta, do business with sleazebags, hack into peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bank accountsÃ¢â‚¬â€without having too much guilt about any of it. Otherwise, just your average working momÃ¢â‚¬â€two boys in elementary school, an off-and-on situation with her sort of semi-ex-husband Horst, life as normal as it ever gets in the neighborhoodÃ¢â‚¬â€till Maxine starts looking into the finances of a computer-security firm and its billionaire geek CEO, whereupon things begin rapidly to jam onto the subway and head downtown. She soon finds herself mixed up with a drug runner in an art deco motorboat, a professional nose obsessed with HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aftershave, a neoliberal enforcer with footwear issues, plus elements of the Russian mob and various bloggers, hackers, code monkeys, and entrepreneurs, some of whom begin to show up mysteriously dead.
