It may be unfair to compare them to the Grateful Dead, but the Doctors often suggest a lighter, more pop-oriented version of that band. While all of the best tracks were issued as singles (&quot;Jimmy Olsen&amp;#039;s Blues,&quot; &quot;Two Princes,&quot; and &quot;Little Miss&quot;), there are still enough good moments on the rest of the album to please anyone who loves the hits.[/b]\n\nRipped from retail CD, enjoy!!!  ;D  ;D  ;D ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba35509af6aad16d6781a4702760c7966d1b9573","amp;dn":"Spin+Doctors.Pocket+Full+of+Kryptonite.%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba35509af6aad16d6781a4702760c7966d1b9573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,53,80,154,246,170,209,109,103,129,164,112,39,96,199,150,109,27,149,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
