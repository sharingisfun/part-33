It contains eighteen songs: sixteen of their most successful singles, &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot; (a cover version in collaboration with Green Day of a song by The Skids) and &quot;Window in the Skies&quot; (a new song). U218 Videos, a DVD featuring music videos from throughout U2's career, was released concurrently.\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart on December 9, 2006 with sales of 134,000 copies. It spent 45 weeks on the chart. As of January 24, 2008, it has sold 847,490 copies in the US. Despite not being released until November 2006, it was the seventh highest-selling album in the world that year\n\nAmazon.com Review By Ben Heege - Whittling down the back catalog of one of the most popular and respected bands of the last quarter-century to a single-disc collection is bound to inspire argument and dissent from the fans and faithful over what is included--and all that gets left behind--and U2's 26-year career is as celebrated and beloved as any band of their generation. U218 Singles doesn't try to please everyone, wisely sticking to the acknowledged high points (and there are many) between 1983's War and 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Nitpickers may quibble that the collection leans too heavily on the band's most popular albums and skips the (admirable if less anthemic) techno-pop tangents of Zooropa and Pop and the earnest energy of the Boy/October years, but the musical majesty accumulated here testifies to the undeniable power and emotion U2 can muster in a four-minute pop song. Two new Rick Rubin-produced tracks don't break new ground for the band, but both would fit snugly somewhere in the U2 canon--&quot;Window in the Skies&quot; is pure late-period arena rock with a typically towering falsetto chorus, while Green Day helps inject some October-era urgency into &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot;. The sum of these 18 tracks is a first-rate primer, perfect for that 10-year-old niece or nephew who thinks U2's big break was that iPod commercial.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By - Danny McKenna - The youthful faces that stare out from the cover of this latest collection of singles from Irish rockers U2 suggests that the focus of the album is, perhaps, their lauded yet under-represented early days. A quick glance through the tracklisting shows that not to be the case, however. There are examples of their rawer 80s sound - &quot;Pride&quot;, &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, &quot;New Year's Day&quot; - but where, older fans may well ask, are songs like &quot;The Electric Co&quot;, &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;I Threw A Brick&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot; from Boy and October? Similarly, songs like &quot;With Or Without You&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot; were on The Best Of 1980-1990, whilst &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; and &quot;Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of&quot; were all on The Best Of 1990-2000. U218 does have the advantage of featuring more recent tracks, including their collaboration with Green Day, &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot; and a new song, &quot;Windows In The Skies&quot;. Whilst dedicated followers of the band may see this as a missed opportunity to offer fans some genuinely rare gems, it still remains a collection of mighty pop music masterpieces.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] I Will Follow\t\t\t\t---&gt; [03:37]\n[02] Beautiful Day\t\t\t\t---&gt; [04:05]\n[03] I Still Havent Found What Im Looking For\t---&gt; [04:38]\n[04] Pride (In The Name Of Love)\t\t---&gt; [03:49]\n[05] With Or Without You\t\t\t---&gt; [04:56]\n[06] Vertigo\t\t\t\t---&gt; [03:10]\n[07] New Year's Day\t\t\t---&gt; [04:18]\n[08] Mysterious Ways\t\t\t---&gt; [04:02]\n[09] Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of\t---&gt; [04:33]\n[10] Where The Streets Have No Name\t\t---&gt; [04:47]\n[11] Sweetest Thing\t\t\t---&gt; [03:01]\n[12] Sunday Bloody Sunday\t\t\t---&gt; [04:40]\n[13] One\t\t\t\t\t---&gt; [04:36]\n[14] Desire\t\t\t\t---&gt; [03:00]\n[15] Walk On\t\t\t\t---&gt; [04:29]\n[16] Elevation\t\t\t\t---&gt; [03:49]\n[17] Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\t---&gt; [05:07]\n[18] The Saints Are Coming\t\t\t---&gt; [03:22] With Green Day\n[19] Window In The Skies\t\t\t---&gt; [04:07]\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t---&gt; 01h:18m:43s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t---&gt; 194mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t---&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t---&gt; I-Tunes v7.1.1.5 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t---&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Rock\n\nRelease Date\t\t---&gt; 17 November 2006 [Ireland] 20 November 2006 [UK] 21 November 2006 [US]\n\nRecord Company \t\t---&gt; Universal Island - Mercury Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t---&gt; http://www.u2.com \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2 \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.u2.com/discography/lyrics \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/U2 \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/u2 \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfa3f624944e2ceeb668efd245a373e1df1eea61","amp;dn":"%5B2006%5D+U218+Singles+-+U2+-+194mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfa3f624944e2ceeb668efd245a373e1df1eea61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,163,246,36,148,78,44,238,182,104,239,210,69,163,115,225,223,30,234,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
