Most people (just like me when I started) don't know how to do this. It simply means that when the download is complete, don't press stop or close down your program. It will then be available to anyone who wants to download it from you. Thanks.\n\nSorry this description is rather long but this software is made of diamonds !!!\n\n\nYou don't have to download all five of these programs but they're not very big (7mb total)!!\n\n                   Hare: the best acceleration utility for PC.\n\nWith Hare, accelerate any computer up to 300%, even latest generation PCs; simply install Hare and be accelerated.\n\n                     Accelerate your computer automatically.\n\nHare doesn't use &quot;classic&quot; acceleration methods, such as a few registry tweaks, and few modified settings. Hare will improve performance no matter what software you use, thanks to a revolutionary compact 88-bit Kernel, which accelerates common system instructions. In addition to that, Hare has a very complete CPU Tasking technology designed to fit your needs; Hare determines automatically what program you use, and how much CPU it must allocate to it.\n\n                    Mem Doubler or intelligent RAM management.\n\nThere are dozens of RAM defragmentation software for PC; forget them all. Mem Doubler has a unique function which is able to determine when your RAM needs to be defragmented! Just tick a checkbox, and Mem Doubler will adapt to your computing style.\n\n                          Automatic RAM preservation.\n\nHow can you run over thirty heavy programs such as Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia Dreamweaver with only 256Mb of RAM? With Hare, and its &quot;Automatic RAM preservation&quot; function: it distributes RAM to programs when they need it, not when they want it.\n\n                              Accelerate games .\n\nWith a set of pre-programmed instructions compatible with nearly all PC games, GameZap will increase your game's frames per second by near 10% in most cases. And GameZap is compatible with OpenGL!\n\nHare features a state-of-art interface, extremely easy to use. Our interface fully respects Microsoft's guidelines and is very intuitive. Most of the time, you won't have to configure Hare, since it works in background, but if you want for example to check out how much free memory you have, or if you feel like fine-tweaking Hare, you'll be delighted by its ease of use, eye-candy icons and comprehensive wizards.\n\nHare features other great functions, such as WinOptimize, a wizard that automatically cleans and optimizes Windows! It is impossible to list all of Hare's functions on a single webpage, so why don't you find out what it feels to have a really fast computer?\n\n              AntiCrash: the most powerful anti-crash tool for PC.\n\nAntiCrash can intercept and fix up to 95.8% crashes, errors, freezes and blue screens.

AutoRepair can find and repair thousands of thousands of problems, with its built-in advanced Artificial Intelligence - all automatically!\n\n                     Anti-boot system for Yahoo Messenger.\n\nBecause sometimes hackers can be just as dangerous as crashes, AntiCrash introduces BootSafe, your ticket for boot-free chatting with Yahoo. If a malicious user tries to boot you, BootSafe intercepts it and deactivates the attempt. You can even configure AntiCrash to ignore certain User ID's!\n\n                       Files protected from corruption.\n\nSometimes, a crash can corrupt your data. Not with AntiCrash, and its built-in safeguard Lifebelt. Lifebelt will automatically backup a copy of all open files if a crash occurs, making it sure for you to always recover all the files you were working on.\n\nIn addition to revolutionary technologies and near-to-perfect performance, AntiCrash features a state-of-art interface, extremely easy to use. Our interface fully respects Microsoft's guidelines and is very intuitive.

If you forget to run AutoRepair, it will automatically remind you to do so; the Main Menu allows you to know AntiCrash's status in a glance; and the list goes on. \n\nAntiCrash features other great functions, such as damaged file recovery or lost data recovery! It is impossible to list all of AntiCrash's functions on a single webpage, so why don't you find out yourself how simple, efficient and complete it is?\n\n\n                 Battery Doubler: double your battery's autonomy.\n\nBattery Doubler can double your battery's autonomy with little to no concessions. Install Battery Doubler, unplug AC power and experience total laptop freedom!\n\nBefore, your only solution to have a decent battery for your laptop was to buy an extra one. Now, there's a lighter, more efficient, and cheaper alternative: Battery Doubler! Because it doesn't use standard techniques (dim screen light, etc.), but finds out what to turn off what isn't needed, such as, for example, the USB ports, you can get up to twice autonomy without sacrificing comfort.\n\n                           Decrease recharge time.\n\nYour battery recharges much faster if your computer isn't turned on. That's a fact. Let Battery Doubler redefine a few computer facts - with its Turbo Charge technology, increase up to 10% battery recharge speed when your computer is turned on.\n\n                       Recalibrate damaged batteries.\n\nAfter using your battery a lot without paying attention to discharging and recharging it fully every time, its performance becomes very low. With Battery Doubler, simply run the recalibration wizard that does the entire job for you - automatically!\n\nFrom the configuration window to the battery status indicator, Battery Doubler excels at ease-of use. Our interface fully respects Microsoft's guidelines and is very intuitive. Because you don't always want to read a 300-page manual before using software, you will understand how to use Battery Doubler in no time.\n\nBattery Doubler features other great functions, such as telling you in hours:minutes your battery's autonomy! It is impossible to list all of Battery Doubler's functions on a single webpage, so why don't you find out how much better your laptop is with it?\n\n                       Zoom: boost startups and shutdowns.\n\nWith Zoom, accelerate startups, shutdowns, standbys, hibernations, and more. Stop waiting for your computer to startup and use that time to do more interesting things!\n\nZoom doesn't only accelerate shutdowns. By putting all startup items, including DOS ones, into cache, it can also accelerate startups up to 200%!\n\nFaster standby and resume, too. If you have a laptop, you certainly use standby and hibernation more than shutdown. They can also be accelerated by Zoom. What's more, Zoom will also accelerate resuming from standby and hibernation; wake your computer up from standby in a few seconds only!\n\n                          More control over shutdown.\n\nZoom gives you control over what your computer does. For example, you can instruct it to display a dialog box on shutdown, if you shut down your computer by mistake. Or perhaps you would like Zoom to automatically reboot a server when it needs to?
