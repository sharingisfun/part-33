Despite the numerous new reports surrounding the tragedy, the public remained largely unaware that three men, U.S. astronauts Donald Pettit and Kenneth Bowersox, and Russian flight engineer Nikolai Budarin, remained orbiting Earth. With the launch program suspended indefinitely, these astronauts, who were already near the end of a fourteen-week mission, had suddenly lost their ride home.\n\nOut of Orbit is the harrowing behind-the-scenes chronicle of the efforts of beleagured Mission Controls in Houston and Moscow, who worked frantically against the clock to bring their men safely back to Earth, ultimately settling on a plan that felt, at best, like a long shot.\n\nGiven that no shuttle could come for them, the astronauts' only hope for a return flight became a Russian-built Soyuz TMA-1 capsule latched to the side of the space stationÃ¢â‚¬â€a piece of equipment roughly the equivalent of a &quot;padded box attached to a parachute,&quot; with a troubled history (in 1971 a malfunction in the Soyuz 11 capsule left three Russian astronauts dead) and dated technology.\n\nGripping and fast-paced, Out of Orbit is an adventure in outer space that will keep you on the edge of your seat. In a day and age when space travel is poised to become available to the masses, Out of Orbit vividly captures both its hazardous realities and soaring majesty.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642f6802264556e497e74463873bc88c8f8509ce","amp;dn":"Out+of+Orbit++%282007+-+Retail+epub+and+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642f6802264556e497e74463873bc88c8f8509ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,47,104,2,38,69,86,228,151,231,68,99,135,59,200,140,143,133,9,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
