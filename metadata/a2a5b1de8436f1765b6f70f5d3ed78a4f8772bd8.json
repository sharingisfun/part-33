Every year for 15 years they have duelled and it's always been a draw. In the 15th year, each refrains from a fatal blow and they realise they can't kill each other because they've become (sort of) friends. The solution is to each train a student - since the students won't know each other, they should be able to kill each other no problem! In a stroke of genius, each actor plays his enemy's student, meaning that we get to see each demonstrate their remarkable skills with both weapons!\n\nDirector: Chia Yung Liu\nStars: Sammo Hung Kam-Bo, Ka-Yan Leung and Chia Yung Liu\nAKA: Eternal Conflict / Shaolin Sabre vs Wu Tang Spear / Bo ming chan dao duo ming qiang\nGenre: Action | Adventure\nAudio: Chinese\nSubtitle: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a5b1de8436f1765b6f70f5d3ed78a4f8772bd8","amp;dn":"The+Odd+Couple+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a5b1de8436f1765b6f70f5d3ed78a4f8772bd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,165,177,222,132,54,241,118,91,111,112,245,211,237,120,164,248,119,43,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
