Black Emperor\nTitle: 'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! (SPEC DTS 5.1 CD by DKA) (SBU)\nRelease Date: 2012\n\nThis is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from the lossless FLAC source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.\n\nOnly playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\n\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nAlways a favorite of mine. This was their first album in a very long while, and a fun one to run through SPEC. Prepare for the bombast around you.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. Mladic\n2. Their Helicopters' Sing\n3. We Drift Like Worried Fire\n4. Strung Like Lights At Thee Printemps Erable\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e7a6abf4ab368d6b72a7ebd9c378143f31e16d","amp;dn":"Godspeed+You%21+Black+Emperor+-+%27Allelujah%21+Don%27t+Bend%21+Ascend%21+%28S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e7a6abf4ab368d6b72a7ebd9c378143f31e16d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,231,166,171,244,171,54,141,107,114,167,235,217,195,120,20,63,49,225,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
