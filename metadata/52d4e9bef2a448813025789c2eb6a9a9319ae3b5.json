His letters were among the earliest documents to be included in the New Testament and, as such, they shaped Christian thinking from the beginning. The Cambridge Companion to St Paul provides an important assessment of this apostle and a fresh appreciation of his continuing significance today. With eighteen chapters written by a team of leading international Pauline specialists, the Companion will have wide appeal and provide an invaluable starting point and cross check for subsequent studies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52d4e9bef2a448813025789c2eb6a9a9319ae3b5","amp;dn":"Cambridge+Companion+to+St.Paul+%5BENG%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52d4e9bef2a448813025789c2eb6a9a9319ae3b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,212,233,190,242,164,72,129,48,37,120,156,46,182,169,169,49,154,227,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
