America is threatened by a mysterious evil power. Pale green distortions in the sky, called &quot;windows&quot;, spawn vicious monsters. Johnny Garland is a young man who has lost his family and his memory in a terrible accident. It turns out that he inherited a fortune from his father, but he is not interested in money, but in re-discovering his own past. For that reason, Johnny becomes a private investigator. He receives an assignment which involves capturing an escaped convict. During the investigation, Johnny meets Shania, a native American woman who works as a monster-hunter. From that point on, the destinies of the two are linked together...\n\nThis installment of the Shadow Hearts series utilizes almost the same gameplay system as Shadow Hearts: Covenant. The turn-based battles are once again controlled by the Judgment Ring: you must stop a spinning indicator on a colored segment of a ring in order to execute a successful attack. New in this game are combo attacks which the players can execute through special areas of the Judgment Ring. \n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82fbb43f9da038992baaf0c442e45d061d9de7bf","amp;dn":"Shadow+Hearts+3+-+From+The+New+World+%5BNTSC%5D%2C+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82fbb43f9da038992baaf0c442e45d061d9de7bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,251,180,63,157,160,56,153,43,170,240,196,66,228,93,6,29,157,231,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
