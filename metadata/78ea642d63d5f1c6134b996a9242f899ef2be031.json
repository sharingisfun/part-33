The book breaks new ground by: * destroying the misconception that black and Asian women lack political involvement * integrating gender into the study of black and Asian political participation in Britain\n* exploring the potential for alliances between black women and the new progressive 'black man's movement'\n* examining black women activists' perception and experiences of white feminism. 'Other Kinds of Dreams also questions the homogeneity of the term 'black' and asks whether increasing social stratification within black communities undermines this unity.\n\n\n\nReview\nAs we trek into the next millennium, asserting, maintaining, and defending our humanity in the face of global capital, we very much need 'Other Kinds of Dreams'.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œAngela Y.
