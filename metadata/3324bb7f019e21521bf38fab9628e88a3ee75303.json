One such record was issued each year from 1963 to 1969\n\nConceived as a means to appease fan-club members whose letters, due to their sheer volume, were not always being answered in a timely manner, the records included the Beatles' messages of thanks to &quot;loyal Beatle people&quot;, along with skits, Christmas carols, and original compositions.\n\n1969: The Beatles' Seventh Christmas Record: Happy Christmas 1969 [320k MP3]\n\n    Recorded: NovemberÃ¢â‚¬â€œDecember 1969\n    Location: various\n    Writer: The Beatles\n    Producer: Maurice Cole\n    Issued: 19 December 1969\n    Label: Lyntone, LYN 1970/1971\n    Flexi disc: 7&quot;, 2 sides, 33Ã¢â€¦â€œ RPM\n    Total time: 7:39\n\nThe final Beatles Christmas offering was also recorded separately, as the band had effectively split by this point.
