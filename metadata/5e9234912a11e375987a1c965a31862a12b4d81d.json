Well-known contributors analyze the numerous ways in which Marxist thought enters into music discourse. Exploring everything from Marxism in hip-hop to feudal properties of Hindustani music to revolutionary music of Central America, the essays in this book find surprising, paradigm-shifting revelations. This book will revolutionize the way music production and consumption is viewed.\n\nISBN-10: 0815337167 | ISBN-13: 978-0815337164 | Publication Date: August 2, 2002 | Edition: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e9234912a11e375987a1c965a31862a12b4d81d","amp;dn":"Music+and+Marx+-+Ideas%2C+Practice%2C+Politics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e9234912a11e375987a1c965a31862a12b4d81d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,146,52,145,42,17,227,117,152,122,28,150,90,49,134,42,18,180,216,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
