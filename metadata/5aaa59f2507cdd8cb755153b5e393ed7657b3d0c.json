Previously it was opening the same location as the\n  current tab. This was causing a lot of support requests because novices\n  can be stuck in DMG view without sidebar (Lion does not have pill\n  button anymore and CMD+OPT+T to show/hide toolbar with sidebar is\n  not very well known keyboard shortcut).\n\n* Show/Hide Path Bar and Show/Hide Status Bar commands work\n  reliably (even in dual mode).\n\n* Resolved some rare crashes in Folder On Top feature.\n\n* Fixed Applescript command for setting window bounds (issue).\n\n* Ironed out more sidebar issues.\n\n* The CrashWatcher was improved and open-sourced. I've also resolve\n  memory leaks.\n\n* TotalFinder.app can be freely relocated. Also optional ~/.totalfinder\n  config is not used anymore.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac OS 10.6 or better, Lion ready\n\n--- PLEASE SEED --","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aaa59f2507cdd8cb755153b5e393ed7657b3d0c","amp;dn":"Total+Finder+v.+1.2.5+pre%5BK%5Bracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aaa59f2507cdd8cb755153b5e393ed7657b3d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,170,89,242,80,124,221,140,183,85,21,59,94,57,62,215,101,123,61,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
