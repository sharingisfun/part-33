John DiNardo (VCH, 1994).pdf\r\n\r\nDerived from the highly acclaimed series Materials Science and Technology, this book provides in-depth coverage of STM, AFM, and related non-contact nanoscale probes along with detailed applications, such as the manipulation of atoms and clusters on a nanometer scale. The methods are described in terms of the physics and the technology of the methods and many high-quality images demonstrate the power of these techniques in the investigation of surfaces and the processes which occur on them.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\nSemiconductor Surfaces and Interfaces * Insulators * Layered Compounds * Charge Density Wave Systems * Superconductors * Electrochemisty at Liquid-Solid Interfaces * Biological Systems * Metrological Applications * Nanoscale Surface Forces * Nanotribology * Manipulation on the Nanoscale\r\n\r\nMaterials scientists, surface scientists, electrochemists, as well as scientists working in catalysis and microelectronics will find this book an invaluable source of information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776fba71fbe0db1e87879c0974ad18c7e7aa98d7","amp;dn":"Nanoscale+Characterization+of+Surfaces+and+Interfaces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776fba71fbe0db1e87879c0974ad18c7e7aa98d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,111,186,113,251,224,219,30,135,135,156,9,116,173,24,199,231,170,152,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
