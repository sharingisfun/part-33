She has his child but finds herself being seduced by her neighbour, the first to show her any emotional warmth. Drawing heavily upon the novel by Theodore Fontaine, Fassbinder uses the central figure as an index of society moralities, as she is exploited by all those that surround her.\n\n___________________________________\n\nDVDrip\n\nTechnical Specs\nSource: Internet\nGroup/Ripper: Unknown\nVideo Format: AVI/MPEG-4 Visual\nVideo Bitrate: 1 391 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nResolution: 608 x 448\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.213\nAudio Format : MP3/MPEG Audio\nAudio Bitrate: 81 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0f20b5c2361b57cec35a54317f43c8ca092164","amp;dn":"Fontane+-+Effi+Briest+%28Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder%2C+1974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0f20b5c2361b57cec35a54317f43c8ca092164","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,15,32,181,194,54,27,87,206,195,90,84,49,127,67,200,202,9,33,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
