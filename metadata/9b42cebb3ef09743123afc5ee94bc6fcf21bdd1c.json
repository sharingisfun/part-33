Also: Germany warns Russia over Ukraine, Japan's energy future post-Fukushima, U.S. abstention from ratifying U.N. disabilities treaty despite presence at Paralympics and Revolutionaries around the world add new social media networks to tech toolkit.\n\nTorrents by CitizenD for the PBS NewsHour are added daily. \n\nDownload may be slow, I recommend you download the SDTV version if you want your news quickly.\n\nAny torrent I put up, I host for at least three weeks, so there will always be at least one seeder for that time even if it shows 0 seeders. I am there uploading nonetheless.\n\nApologies for the delay in getting it online today.\n\n\nBe more PBS!\n\nSupport your local PBS station.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b42cebb3ef09743123afc5ee94bc6fcf21bdd1c","amp;dn":"PBS.NewsHour.2014.03.13.Thursday.720p.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b42cebb3ef09743123afc5ee94bc6fcf21bdd1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,66,206,187,62,240,151,67,18,58,252,94,233,75,198,252,242,27,221,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
