No, scrub that, filmmakers adore a bad prison. You can see why. For writers and directors, the volatile jail is a ready-made theatre, its prisoners and guards with their various conflicts and loyalties all perfect players for a drama that, if it tries hard enough, can reflect life on the outside too.\n\nFor French director Jacques Audiard (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“A Self-Made HeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Beat That My Heart SkippedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), a master of the old-school French thriller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ie thrilling and meaningful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ his fifth film offers the chance to pull off both a state-of-nation primal scream and a terrific crime flick. He gives us Malik (Tahar Rahim), a French-Arab convict who enters a concrete-and-steel hell to serve a sentence of six years (so we know he canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have done anything too dreadful). He tries to keep his head down, but this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t that sort of place. The ruling bully boys are the Corsican inmates, led by ageing but vicious CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar (Niels Arestrup), who forces Malik to kill another inmate in a very successful scene thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the most claustrophobic and disturbing episodes IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen in a long while. From here, Malik is CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vassal, committed to working for him on the inside and, later, using a series of day-release excursions to represent his criminal interests on the outside.\n\nBut Malik is a clever individualist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a survivalist even ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and at the same time that he learns to read and write, he exploits a friendship with another French-Arab prisoner, now released, to pursue his own drug deals and quietly invest in a power base within the jail. This is a world where partnerships are formed only for a reason, loyalties are fluid, friends barely exist at all. Politically, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a cynical film. Hope is absent.\n\nWhether, though, it says anything meaningful about France, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not so sure. Malik is an extreme character, so his experience doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t reflect the French-Arab dilemma as a whole, even if the point is made about the number of immigrants in French jails and how being sent to prison for a minor offence can snowball into something else entirely. Audiard suggests that being an underdog ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ socially, racially, economically ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in an unfriendly society can lead to desocialisation and anti-social behaviour. But MalikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story is so wild that it obscures such ideas.\n\nThat said, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s testament to AudiardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skill at plunging us headfirst into a vicious parallel world that we mostly believe the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s twisted logic and rituals. Also, his presentation of violence as a profit-and-loss account is effective and mature: while MalikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s initial murder may get him far, we witness nightly visions of his victim coming back to his cell to haunt him. But there are several bite-your-tongue moments. The film is realist in style and mood, but for every five spot-on observations, there is one flight of wild fancy. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen the film twice and still find baffling an episode in which Malik predicts that a deer will hit a car, thereby suggesting he is a prophet.\n\nBut the sheer force of AudiardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s direction can support such enigmas. It forces you, bullies you, persuades you to love his filmmaking style ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even if not always to understand his motives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b9678e814130e7d7ec28154cf476b1202a6056","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+16%29+A+PROPHET+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b9678e814130e7d7ec28154cf476b1202a6056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,185,103,142,129,65,48,231,215,236,40,21,76,244,118,177,32,42,96,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
