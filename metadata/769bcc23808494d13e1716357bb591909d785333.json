He sets out to wed her but finds that she will only wed Rajkumar Abhikshit, the son of Ayodhya's Maharaj Karamdham. This alliance does not auger well with Vishal and Karamdham, and when Adbhikshit is captured and held in the dungeons, his father is all set to wage war. Mandakini manages to pacify everyone but then Abhikshit refuses to marry her as he was humiliated by her father. After severe penance, she gets him to change his mind and they get married. But their happiness will not last long as soon she will be forced to recollect a curse - in a previous life - which results in crippling her husband. They are told that he can cured after a Tirathyatra on foot without any riches nor transportation. The duo set out and face many trials and challenges\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATRIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1361 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate:111kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:18:32\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 2:18:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:769bcc23808494d13e1716357bb591909d785333","amp;dn":"Jahan+Sati+Wahan+Bhagwan+%281965%29+Xvid+2cd+-+No+Subs+%5BDDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"769bcc23808494d13e1716357bb591909d785333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,155,204,35,128,132,148,209,62,23,22,53,123,181,145,144,157,120,83,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
