It is composed of roughly 10,000 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of the poem's twelve books tell the story of Aeneas' wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem's second half tells of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed.\n\nYou know the drill, seed or don't download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e43e282b8176af0c10d321e14252c7d83a60c13","amp;dn":"The+Aeneid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e43e282b8176af0c10d321e14252c7d83a60c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,67,226,130,184,23,106,240,193,13,50,30,20,37,44,125,131,166,12,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
