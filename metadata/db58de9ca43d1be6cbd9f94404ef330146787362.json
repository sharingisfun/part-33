It was hard to find any un-mangled versions of these files! The video quality is at a decent level for an 80's TV show, but today's DVD qualities are higher in comparison. I transcoded these from the AVI source files using x264 with a CRF of 23, which is a good MSD type quality, especially considering the source material. Season 1 is 640x480, and season 2 is mainly 544x400 with a few at 576x432.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db58de9ca43d1be6cbd9f94404ef330146787362","amp;dn":"War+Of+The+Worlds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db58de9ca43d1be6cbd9f94404ef330146787362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,88,222,156,164,61,27,230,203,217,249,68,4,239,51,1,70,120,115,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
