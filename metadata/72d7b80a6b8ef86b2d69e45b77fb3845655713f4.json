Through every succeeding war in U.S. history, field artillery has been indispensable to the armed forces. Field Artillery, compiled by Janice E. McKenney and the newest volume in the Army Lineage Series, was first published in 1985. This two-part second edition updates the lineages, honors, and heraldic items of the Regular Army's field artillery regiments and further expands them to include organizations above the regimental level, as well as Army National Guard units. Field Artillery serves as a companion to McKenney's book The Organizational History of Field Artillery, 1775-2003 (Center of Military History, 2007), which explores the development of field artillery in the United States Army.\n\n\n\nPart 1\n\n# Paperback 817 Pages\n# Publisher: Center of Military History; Revised edition (2008)\n# ISBN-10: 0057192000\n# ASIN: B004UHSHUO\n\n\nPart 2\n\n# Paperback  754 Pages\n# Publisher: Center of Military History; Revised edition (2008)\n# ISBN-10: 0057192000\n# ASIN: B004UHQ12U","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d7b80a6b8ef86b2d69e45b77fb3845655713f4","amp;dn":"Field+Artillery%3AArmy+Lineage+Series%28Part+1+and+2%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d7b80a6b8ef86b2d69e45b77fb3845655713f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,215,184,10,107,142,248,107,45,105,228,91,119,251,56,69,101,87,19,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
