Those homes were never quite finished but the owners have had to move in. So, two years later, Piers is returning to tackle a final set of challenges. With unexpected design dilemmas to solve, all on a shoestring budget, it's now or never as they battle to complete their homes for good.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nIn this first episode, pizza van owner Martin from Leeds not only saved money but also improved his building by stepping out of his comfort zone, ditching conventional approaches to the build. But now, he's still got a series of rooms to finish and is at a total loss of what to do. Piers must find a way to rejuvenate Martin's thirst for an incredible home without blowing his budget. Kieran and Piers struggled to get Ruth and Tony to see how important decisions they made on the outside of their home were to it fitting in with the stunning Shropshire landscape. Now, they are facing their biggest and final challenge - to make their modern home blend with the ramshackle collection of buildings that surround it. But will inspiration from one of the country's most stunning contemporary homes be too much for them, and can a solution be found for less than Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200?\n\n2)  Part 2 \nSumati had just Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£50,000 to build her home in the Scottish borders. She wrestled with fresh design ideas and inexpensive interior finishes, but a year on her home remains incomplete and is now under threat. With driving wind and rain causing damage to the unfinished exterior, Piers must find a way to reinvigorate Sumati to complete her home before it's too late. Young Devon farmers, Justin and Mary, spent every penny they had creating their first home together. Today it is home to baby Oscar too, but their low cost home is dominated by a forest of baby gates and their prime living spaces have become cramped and cluttered. With a budget of just Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200, Piers is challenged to come up with a bespoke design solution to reclaim their precious space - but having shied away from distinctive design ideas in the past, will Justin and Mary take the leap?\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d199b8b6b9919de5ffe0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3025 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 2\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.31 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05zpsqq\n\n2)  Related Documentaries \n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20House%20That%20100k%20Built\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20100k%20House%3A%20Tricks%20of%20the%20Trade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027f3a0f8e292e71a994280d93d226424cdd887a","amp;dn":"The.100k.House.The.Final.Fix.1of2.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027f3a0f8e292e71a994280d93d226424cdd887a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,127,58,15,142,41,46,113,169,148,40,13,147,210,38,66,76,221,136,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
