Colten and Bruce M. Altevogt\n2006 \nISBN: 0309101115 \n424 Pages \nPDF \n2.25 MB\n\n\nClinical practice related to sleep problems and sleep disorders has been expanding rapidly in the last few years, but scientific research is not keeping pace. Sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome are three examples of very common disorders for which we have little biological information. This new book cuts across a variety of medical disciplines such as neurology, pulmonology, pediatrics, internal medicine, psychiatry, psychology, otolaryngology, and nursing, as well as other medical practices with an interest in the management of sleep pathology. This area of research is not limited to very young and old patients - sleep disorders reach across all ages and ethnicities. &quot;Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&quot; presents a structured analysis that explores the following: improving awareness among the general public and health care professionals; increasing investment in interdisciplinary somnology and sleep medicine research training and mentoring activities; and validating and developing new and existing technologies for diagnosis and treatment. This book will be of interest to those looking to learn more about the enormous public health burden of sleep disorders and sleep deprivation and the strikingly limited capacity of the health care enterprise to identify and treat the majority of individuals suffering from sleep problems................\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a430b09a3d9c919d97910c0e0eac6de0b532da6","amp;dn":"Sleep+Disorders+and+Sleep+Deprivation%3A+An+Unmet+Public+Health+Pr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a430b09a3d9c919d97910c0e0eac6de0b532da6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,67,11,9,163,217,201,25,217,121,16,192,224,234,198,222,11,83,45,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
