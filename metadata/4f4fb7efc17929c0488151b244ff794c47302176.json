It comes from side 2 of the first monthly release, which was on cassette, and sent out to the handful of DJ&amp;#039;s who had joined Tony Prince&amp;#039;s brand new DJ only mixes service in February 1983.\n\nTrack listing:\n\nThere It Is\nA Night To Remember \nI Can Make You Feel Good \nI Owe You One \nAttention To My Baby\nSecond Time Around \nMake That Move \nPlaying To Win\nFriends\n\nDuration: 12 mins.\n\nThese two mixes are the only ones on the cassette. The remainder of side 2 contains previews. These were new and complete singles which DMC thought would do well in the charts, and which members were encouraged to play &amp; promote.\nThere was also a second tape &amp; this contained previews only.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f4fb7efc17929c0488151b244ff794c47302176","amp;dn":"2%29+DMC+Shalamar+megamix+%28from+their+1st+tape%2C+Feb+1983%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f4fb7efc17929c0488151b244ff794c47302176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,79,183,239,193,121,41,192,72,129,81,178,68,255,121,76,71,48,33,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
