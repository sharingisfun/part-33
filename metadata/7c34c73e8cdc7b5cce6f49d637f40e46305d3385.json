Lyrics also included.

Please help keep these torrents alive.  Whenever you grab a torrent, you should continue to seed for others, at least until your ratio reaches 1.0 or higher.  I'm still kind of new to this, but I believe that if you make any changes to what you've downloaded or move them from their original download location, it will stop seeding.  I usually COPY my music files from my download folder to an empty folder on my desktop, rename them how I like, then add them to my music library.  This leaves the torrent in its original condition and location so it will seed for others.\n\nWe've all been frustrated by dead and incomplete torrents.  This wouldn't happen if everyone seeded until their ratio got over 1.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c34c73e8cdc7b5cce6f49d637f40e46305d3385","amp;dn":"Zero+Zero+-+A.M.+Gold+2001++++AM+Gold++Lyrics+included","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c34c73e8cdc7b5cce6f49d637f40e46305d3385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,52,199,62,140,220,123,92,206,111,73,214,55,244,14,70,48,93,51,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
