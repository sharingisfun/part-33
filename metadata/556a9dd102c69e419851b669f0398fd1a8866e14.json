Gritty blues, soaring jams, special guests--this show has something for every Peachhead.\n\nThe first set featured the classic opening combo of Don't Want You No More and It's Not My Cross To Bear, plus a down and dirty, Good Morning Little Schoolgirl, and really achieved liftoff with a double-decker Dreams that saw both Derek and Warren reaching for the sky.  Boston resident Garrett &quot;G Love&quot; Dutton stepped out and added some &quot;special sauce&quot; on harmonica for You Don't Love Me and proved that there are some serious blues chops behind his easygoing persona, providing an exclamation point on a powerful first set.\n\nThe second set was wrapped up in a big Mountain Jam sandwich, always a treat, and this was a full-bodied triple-decker version, with THREE different Mountain Jam segemnts throughout the set!  The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down made a rare appearance at this show, with Gregg singing with passion.  Gregg also sounded great on Key To The Highway.  The other highlight was a jaw-dropping version of That's What Love Will Make You Do that may be the best version of this classic tune you'll ever hear.  Special guest guitarist Junior Mack ripped on this!\n\nWhipping Post is the only way to end such an epic three-night run, and this version does not disappoint!  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc One\n\n1.
