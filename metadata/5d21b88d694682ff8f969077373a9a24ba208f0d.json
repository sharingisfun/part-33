Eight songs, from a lovely 8-minute opening cut, 'Rejoice in the Lord alway' and the jubilant 'I was glad,' written for James II's coronation, to the short, deeply moving 'Hear My Prayer, O Lord' and the 16-minute final cut, 'My heart is inditing,' Purcell's grandest composition for the church.\n\nThe perfect accompaniment of Capriccio fits perfectly with Chanticleer's flawless singing. 'Evening' is inspirational and pleasing on many levels.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d21b88d694682ff8f969077373a9a24ba208f0d","amp;dn":"Purcell+-+Anthems+and+Sacred+Songs+-+Chanticleer+%28VBR+-+V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d21b88d694682ff8f969077373a9a24ba208f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,33,184,141,105,70,130,255,143,150,144,119,55,58,154,36,186,32,143,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
