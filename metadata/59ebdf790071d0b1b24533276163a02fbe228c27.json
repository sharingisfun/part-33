She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1968, and received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1991. She has sat on the board of judges for the PEN/Newman's Own Award, and her novel Blue Angel, a satire about sexual harassment on college campuses, was a finalist for the National Book Award. She is now teaching at Bard College.\n\nA Changed Man\nWhat is charismatic Holocaust survivor Meyer Maslow to think when a rough-looking young neo-Nazi named Vincent Nolan walks into the Manhattan office of Maslow's human rights foundation and declares that he wants to &quot;save guys like me from becoming guys like me&quot;? As Vincent gradually turns into the sort of person who might actually be able to do this, he also transforms those around him: Meyer Maslow, who fears heroism has become a desk job; the foundation's dedicated fund-raiser, Bonnie Kalen, an appealingly vulnerable divorced single mother; and even Bonnie's teenage son.\n\nFrancine Prose's A Changed Man is a darkly comic and masterfully inventive novel that poses essential questions about human nature, morality, and the capacity for personal reinvention.\n\nBlue Angel\nIt has been years since Swenson, a professor in a New England creative writing program, has published a novel. It's been even longer since any of his students have shown promise. Enter Angela Argo, a pierced, tattooed student with a rare talent for writing. Angela is just the thing Swenson needs. And, better yet, she wants his help. But, as we all know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. . . .\n\nDeliciously risquÃƒÂ©, Blue Angel is a withering take on today's academic mores and a scathing tale that vividly shows what can happen when academic politics collides with political correctness.\n\nGuided Tours of Hell\nInvited to PragueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first annual Kafka conference to read from his play about the great Czech writer, a playwright named Landau finds himself upstaged by Jiri Krakauer, the dashing Holocaust survivor whose claim to fame is a long-ago death-camp love affair with KafkaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister. On a visit to the camp, Landau attempts to prove that Krakauer is lyingÃ¢â‚¬â€risking his career to destroy that of another.\n\nOn the other side of Europe, Nina and Leo go on a macabre tour of their own. A guidebook editor and his besotted assistant, they are enduring a miserable French vacation when Leo suggests a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paris Death Trip,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ taking in catacombs, prisons, and all the darkest corners of the City of Light.\n\nHunters and Gatherers\nMartha is thirty, and her life has stalled. Her last boyfriend turned cruel long before he left her, her fact-checking job is underpaying and unfulfilling, and the aimlessness of her twentiesÃ¢â‚¬â€which she thought was just a phaseÃ¢â‚¬â€has become her defining characteristic. She is wandering along the beach when she spies a group of women performing a strange spiritual ceremony that stirs something deep within her. With names like Isis Moonwagon and Hegwitha, they have given themselves fully to the worship of the Goddess. After Martha earns an honored place in their budding religion, she gets to know its members and finds that the New Age has some of the same problems as the old one.\n\nJudah the Pious\nThe Polish monarch has outlawed a portion of the Jewish funeral rite, and none of the communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lawyers, judges, or scholars will come forward to defend the custom before the crown. Only one man dares challenge the sovereign: the spindly old Rabbi Eliezer of Rimanov, whose eccentric habits conceal the mind of a dreamer and the curiosity of a child.\n\nThe rabbi is reduced to laughter at the sight of the king, for the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ruler is but a boyÃ¢â‚¬â€and Rabbi Eliezer knows how to speak to youngsters. They make a bet: If the rabbi can convince him that there is more to the universe than meets the eye, the funeral rite will be restored. To make his case, Eliezer launches into the story of Judah ben Simon, a tale of such majesty and wonder that it promises to make a dreamer out of all who hear it, changing them forevermore.\n\nLovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932: A Novel\nA richly imagined and stunningly inventive literary masterpiece of love, art, and betrayal, exploring the genesis of evil, the unforeseen consequences of love, and the ultimate unreliability of storytelling itself.\n\nParis in the 1920s shimmers with excitement, dissipation, and freedom. It is a place of intoxicating ambition, passion, art, and discontent, where louche jazz venues like the Chameleon Club draw expats, artists, libertines, and parvenus looking to indulge their true selves. It is at the Chameleon where the striking Lou Villars, an extraordinary athlete and scandalous cross-dressing lesbian, finds refuge among the clubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s loyal denizens, including the rising Hungarian photographer Gabor Tsenyi, the socialite and art patron Baroness Lily de Rossignol; and the caustic American writer Lionel Maine.\n\nAs the years pass, their fortunesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the world itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€evolve. Lou falls desperately in love and finds success as a race car driver. Gabor builds his reputation with startlingly vivid and imaginative photographs, including a haunting portrait of Lou and her lover, which will resonate through all their lives. As the exuberant twenties give way to darker times, Lou experiences another metamorphosisÃ¢â‚¬â€sparked by tumultuous eventsÃ¢â‚¬â€that will warp her earnest desire for love and approval into something far more.\nMy New American Life: A Novel\nLula, a twenty-six-year-old Albanian woman living surreptitiously in New York City on an expiring tourist visa, hopes to make a better life for herself in America. When she lands a job as caretaker to Zeke, a rebellious high school senior in suburban New Jersey, it seems that the security, comfort, and happiness of the American dream may finally be within reach. Her new boss, Mister Stanley, an idealistic college professor turned Wall Street executive, assumes that Lula is a destitute refugee of the Balkan wars. He enlists his childhood friend Don Settebello, a hotshot lawyer who prides himself on defending political underdogs, to straighten out Lula's legal situation. In true American fashion, everyone gets what he wants and feels good about it.\n\nBut things take a more sinister turn when Lula's Albanian &quot;brothers&quot; show up in a brand-new black Lexus SUV. Hoodie, Leather Jacket, and the Cute One remind her that all Albanians are family, but what they ask of her is no small favor. Lula's new American life suddenly becomes more complicated as she struggles to find her footing as a stranger in a strange new land. Is it possible that her new American life is not so different from her old Albanian one?\n\nSet in the aftermath of 9/11, My New American Life offers a vivid, darkly humorous, bitingly real portrait of a particular moment in history, when a nation's dreams and ideals gave way to a culture of cynicism, lies, and fear. Beneath its high comic surface, the novel is a more serious consideration of immigration, of what it was like to live through the Bush-Cheney years, and of what it means to be an American\n\nPrimitive People\nSimone has gotten used to living in fear. After years of dictatorship, Haiti has sunk into chaos, and death is ever present. But it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the corpse she finds on her doorstep that convinces Simone to flee the island of her birthÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the night she sees her lover with his arm draped around the shoulder of another. Death is one thing, but she cannot tolerate heartbreak.\n\nThe assistant to the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cultural attachÃƒÂ©, Simone is clever enough to get herself a green card. But when she gets to New York, she finds that her smarts cannot guarantee her a job. Accepting a position as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“caregiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a wealthy community upstate, Simone finds herself little more than a glorified nanny to a pair of astonishingly spoiled children. But there is a dark side to her humble new life among the WASPs, and this ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© will find that the rich can be more barbaric than she ever knew.\n\nSicilian Odyssey\nA blending of art and cultural criticism, travel writing, and personal narrative, Sicilian Odyssey is Francine Prose's imaginative consideration of the diverse cultural legacies found juxtaposed and entangled on the Mediterranean island of Sicily. She writes of the intensity of Sicily, the &quot;commitment to the extreme,&quot; where the history is more colorful, the sun hotter, the cooking earthier, the violence more horrific, the carnival more raucous, the politics more Byzantine than other places on Earth, and how much the island can teach us about the triumph of beauty over violence and life over death.\n\nProse examines architectural sites and objects and looks at the ways in which myth and actuality converge. Exploring the intact and beautiful Greek amphitheaters at Siracusa and Taormina, the cathedral at Monreale, the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, and some of the masterpieces of the Baroque scattered throughout the island, Prose focuses her keen insight to imagine them in their own time, to examine the evolution and decline of the cultures that produced them, and to deconstruct powerful responses each evokes in her.\n\nThe Peaceable Kingdom\nThe citizens of ProseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s realm are perpetually experiencing surprises. Nothing is reliable in their world, where dream vacations, weddings, and parties go sideways; strangers make unexpected confessions; and even family pets can sow discord. The peaceable kingdom of the everyday is streaked with darker, harsher truths.\n\nThe Turning\nA dark house.\nAn isolated island.\nStrange dreams \nand even stranger \nvisions . . .\n\nJack is spending the summer on a private island far from modern conveniences. No Wi-Fi, no cell service, no one else on the island but a housekeeper and the two very peculiar children in his care. The first time Jack sees the huge black mansion atop a windswept hill, he senses something cold, something more sinister than even the dark house itself.\n\nSoon, he feels terribly isolated and alone. Yet he is not alone. The house has visitorsÃ¢â‚¬â€peering in the windows, staring from across the shore. But why doesn't anyone else see them . . . and what do they want? As secrets are revealed and darker truths surface, Jack desperately struggles to maintain a grip on reality. He knows what he sees, and he isn't crazy. . . . Or is he?\n\nFrom nationally acclaimed author Francine Prose comes a mind-bending story that will leave you realizing how subtle the lines that separate reality, imagination, and insanity really are.\n\nTouch\nDid they, or didn't they?\n\nDid she, or didn't she?\nSomething happened to fourteen-year-old Maisie WillardÃ¢â‚¬â€something involving her three friends, all boys. But their stories don't match, and the rumors spin out of control. Then other people get involved . . . the school, the parents, the lawyers. The incident at the back of the bus becomes the center of Maisie's life, the talk of the school and, horribly, it becomes news. With just a few words and a touch, the kids and their community are changed forever.\n\nFrom nationally acclaimed author Francine Prose comes an unforgettable story about the difficulties of telling the truth, the consequences of lying, and the most dangerous twist of allÃ¢â‚¬â€the possibility that you yourself will come to believe something that you know isn't true.\n\nWomen and Children First\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing for your husband to leave you for another woman, but how is a person supposed to feel when the man of her dreams abandons her for the stars themselves? In the twelve tales of Women and Children First, Francine Prose shows us an alcoholic trying to improve himself by fasting, a housewife enrolled in the New Consciousness Academy, and a French literature professor whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s begun to fear Madame Bovary. ProseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters are lost, frightened, and aloneÃ¢â‚¬â€and far more like us than we might care to admit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ebdf790071d0b1b24533276163a02fbe228c27","amp;dn":"Francine+Prose+Collection+%2813+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ebdf790071d0b1b24533276163a02fbe228c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,235,223,121,0,113,208,177,178,69,51,39,97,99,160,47,190,34,140,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
