While looking for a place to live, a friend puts him in touch with Sherlock Holmes, and the two agree to share lodgings in Baker Street. Holmes proves an interesting if eccentric companion. When Holmes receives a message from the police, Watson learns that he is a private consulting detective, and soon finds himself assisting Holmes in investigating a murder case. Peter Cunningham has been found stabbed to death, with his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e standing over him holding a knife - but Scotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade is baffled by the lack of a motive for the crime.\n\nVideo: MPEG1 Video 352x240 (8:5) 29.97fps 1150Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio 44100Hz stereo 224Kbps\nRunning time: 0:27:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:151ecd04e9a973c2b985c9cdd156e93bb132cb95","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+-+The+Case+of+the+Cunningham+Heritage+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"151ecd04e9a973c2b985c9cdd156e93bb132cb95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,30,205,4,233,169,115,194,185,133,201,205,209,86,233,59,177,50,203,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
