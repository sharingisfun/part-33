Schauberger, a famous austrian natural philosopher, pioneered his own philosophy of water which is based on natural observation of its vortex-like movement. 220 pages, some pictures.\n\nFrom the backcover:\nViktor Schauberger was a pioneering genius who combined keen observation of nature with intuitive brilliance and a sharp engineer&amp;#039;s brain. He made a lifelong study of water - from mountain streams to river flows and from domestic supplies to advanced hydraulics - developed profound and radical theories about its inherent energies, which earned him the name of the Water wizard.\nAccording to Schauberger, water is akin to blood in the human body - the most important life-giving and energy-empowering substance on the planet. Yet, with incorrect, ignorant handling, it becomes diseased, affecting human, animal and vegetable life alike, causing physical decay and, in the case of people, their moral, mental and spiritual deterioration as well.\nSchauberger was a fearless exponent of natural energy and a fascinating polemicist, revelling in doing battle with contemporary orthodox scientists. Sadly, the same extractive and water management policies which brought devastation and widespread pollution in his day have even greater consequences today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e487d2ce70817faedaee4ca9365640b0e338879","amp;dn":"Coats+%26+Schauberger+-+The+water+wizard+-+The+extraordinary+prope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e487d2ce70817faedaee4ca9365640b0e338879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,72,125,44,231,8,23,250,237,174,228,202,147,101,100,11,14,51,136,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
