During the winter, some songs are written, and afterwards recorded. At this point this two man orchestra is forced to grow. They need someone to vocalize their words scribbled down in distress. Luckily, a suitable interpreter is close to be found. In autumn 2001 this trio shuts off in a bunker deep underground, to give birth to the first ShamRain - release.\n\nWhile getting the songs together for the 3rd album, Shamrain is offered a deal by Spikefarm Records. As soon as the deal is sorted out, the band escapes the summer brightness to the studio. The sessions turn out to be the hardest Shamrain - sessions ever. It takes a lot of despair and disagreements, not to mention time, to get the album finalized, but it seems to be worth it. The new album represents the band more challenging and varieting as never before.The album is titled &amp;#039;Goodbye to All That&amp;#039; and released 31.10.2007. Album enters the official Finnish charts at position 39.\n\n\n\nTracklisting\n\nQUOTE\n1. Holding the Earth...............................04.02\n2.
