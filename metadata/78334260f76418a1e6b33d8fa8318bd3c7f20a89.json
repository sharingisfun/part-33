It sounds a bit like &quot;Think Of Me&quot; from Phantom of the Opera.\n\n  At the end, the Peddler from the beginning of the film returns to sing a reprise of &quot;Arabian Nights.&quot; A slightly rewritten version of this song was used to close the sequel film, Aladdin and the King of Thieves.\n\n   The quality isn't great. Sound levels are low and hissy, picture is grainy and wobbly (though clean enough). This could have used some restoration, but oh well, here it is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78334260f76418a1e6b33d8fa8318bd3c7f20a89","amp;dn":"Aladdin+Disney+Early+Workprint+1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78334260f76418a1e6b33d8fa8318bd3c7f20a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,51,66,96,247,100,24,161,230,179,61,143,168,49,139,211,199,242,10,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
