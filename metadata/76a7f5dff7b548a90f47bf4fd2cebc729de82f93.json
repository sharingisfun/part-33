Dawkins presents strong and valid arguments against the modern return to so-called alternative or ancient medicines.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s a little audio de-sync in the early parts of the file, but it comes out fine in the latter two-thirds.  Hope its not too distracting, but this was after seven attempts to tweak this into complete synch and this was the best I could do.
