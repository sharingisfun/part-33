What has hampered Brookmeyer these days from getting any kind of residual acclaim is the fact that so many of his early masterpieces are simply unavailable.  His spate of activity for Verve Records alone includes the mainstream brilliance of The Blues, Hot and Cold and the wistfully melodic strains of Trombone Jazz Samba.  In addition, one would have to add the United Artists release Kansas City Revisited to the list of quintessential Brookmeyer sides yet to see the light of day on CD. \n\nWorking in a quartet setting, Brookmeyer matches personalities flawlessly with guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Bill Crow, and drummer Mel Lewis, while paying homage to iconoclast composer Alec Wilder.  One of the best and most memorable tunes from the Wilder cannon is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhile WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Young,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ treated here as a waltz and finding Brookmeyer playing piano with a minimalist approach.  The other line which might be familiar is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s So Peaceful In the Country,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rendered ever so delicately this time with our leading man on trombone.  Not lost on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s astute musicians, this melodic jewel can also be heard in a more recent version by pianist Bill Charlap.\n\nBrookmeyer would pen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlues For AlecÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it serves as one of the lengthier cuts, Hall and the trombonist stretching out in a bluesy vein that brings out the best solos of the set.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also here that you really notice the way this ensemble breathes as one, Lewis and Crow never intruding on the generally restrained mood, but not failing either to support the soloists firmly.  A sublime gem that deserves a reissue, along with the rest of his Verve sides, 7 x Wilder is Brookmeyer at his finest with an obscure performance from Jim Hall to boot.&quot; ~ all about jazz.com\n\nPersonnel:\nBob Brookmeyer (vtb, p)\nJim Hall (g)\nBill Crow (b)\nMel Lewis (d)\n\nBob Brookmeyer - 7 x Wilder Tracks:\n01  While We're Young (Wilder-Emvick-Palitz) 6:17\n02  That's The Way It Goes (Wilder-Robin) 4:49\n03  The Wrong Blues (Wilder-Envick) 4:39\n04  It's So Peaceful In The Country (Wilder) 4:10\n05  Blues For Alec (Brookmeyer) 6:13\n06  I'll Be Around (Wilder) 4:36\n07  Who Can I Turn To?
