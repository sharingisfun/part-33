What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nTonight - Week 9 - Friday - Gary and Matt kick off this special MasterClass by officially welcoming and congratulating this season's Top 10. Topping off the week with an amazing Italian feast. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de815327a2cc14f2efc43a228553421ff2886491","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E54.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de815327a2cc14f2efc43a228553421ff2886491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,129,83,39,162,204,20,242,239,196,58,34,133,83,66,31,242,136,100,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
