The series was based on novels and short stories written by Huggins prior to his arrival at Warner, but, as a matter of legal record, derived from a brief Caribbean theatrical release of its pilot, Girl on the Run. The show ran from 1958 to 1964.\n\nThis torrent contains 5 of the 41 episodes from season 4. Two of these videos are not 100% downloaded, as indicated on their file labels. However, there are almost no problems viewing them.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddeb9d24b0a22a67985a3e05f2f316807138b2a8","amp;dn":"77+Sunset+Strip+-+Season+4+%28incomplete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddeb9d24b0a22a67985a3e05f2f316807138b2a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,235,157,36,176,162,42,103,152,90,62,5,242,243,22,128,113,56,178,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
