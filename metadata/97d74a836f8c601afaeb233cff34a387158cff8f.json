Not that the \n     Danish composer/producer/remixer is above contrasts, as in &quot;Evil Dub,&quot; \n     where he  allows  down-tuned and  distorted  guitars  to run  like the \n     proverbial bull in a china shop of elegant, understated programming. \n     \n     But tracks like &quot;While the Cold Winter  Waiting&quot; beg comparison to the \n     frosty, glockenspiel-laced ambience of  Iceland's mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºm, and the closer, \n     &quot;Miss You,&quot; is a hypnotic lullaby sure to receive ample acclaim. After \n     all, TrentemÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ller's music is distinctly his own, and his eerie command \n     of dynamics allows him a broad  palette, exemplified by a gripping bit \n     of  turntablism  that  pops up in  one of the  album's first  singles, \n     &quot;Always Something  Better.&quot; The second  disc's bonus  material reveals\n     the man the  DJ community  has long known:  the patient  architect who \n     unobtrusively builds beats, loops,  and motifs into a critical mass of \n     refined minimalism. All this leaves  little doubt that The Last Resort \n     will earn TrentemÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ller converts from downtempo and electronica circles \n     well beyond his established fan base.\n\n\n--/\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n /\\/\\  Group Info\n-\\/_/-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n     eXP is not a scene group.
