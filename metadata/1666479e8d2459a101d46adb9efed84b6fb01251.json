This is Nervecell&amp;#039;s second CD, self released in 2008.  Let me tell you right now, this is what Death Metal should be and has always wanted to be.  What Nervecell brings to the table is not your average growling, screaming, Cannibal-Corpse-ish monotonous guitar riffs, but a beat and sound that has been only slightly tapped upon by some bands, yet never truly glorified to its fullest.  Bands such as Demiurg and Kataklysm (in their most recent releases) have done some incredible things, but nothing to the scale which Nervecell takes it.  Now, I&amp;#039;m no critic of music, although sometimes I act like one; I don&amp;#039;t have a site that tells you the ratings of different metal bands, but I can tell you honestly that this is an album that you do not want to pass up.  If I were to give it a rating, I would rate it 10/10 easily.  Every track, from the intro (which is instrumental) to the end, leaves you in awe.
