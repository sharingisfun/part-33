(1969) [1994]\n\nAfter Breau's major-label debut, Guitar Sounds From Lenny Breau was issued the previous year on RCA, producer Chet Atkins arranged for this live recording in Los Angeles. Session bassist Carol Kaye was in the audience and stated in an interview:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ \t&quot;If you had dropped a bomb on the place that night you'd have wiped out all the guitar players in the world. They were all down there, from Howard Roberts to George Van Eps to Joe Pass... He conquered Hollywood because we all loved him as a player and we loved him as a person.&quot; \tÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe tapes from the three-night engagement were taken back to Nashville where Atkins, Danny Davis and Ronnie Light prepared them for release.[2]\n\nDespite the enthusiasm for the live show, the album sold poorly and was barely mentioned in the music press at the time. Breau was later quoted as saying, &quot;When I initially recorded, I didn't feel readyÃ¢â‚¬â€I wanted to practice for another 10 years first.&quot; He also felt RCA did not sufficiently promote the release.[1][2] It was 10 years before Breau released another solo album.\n\nThe Velvet Touch was re-released on CD by One Way Records in 1994. It is currently out of print.\n\nTrack list:\n\n    Tuning Time\n    No Greater Love\n    The Claw\n    Indian Reflections for Ravi\n    That's All\n    Blues Theme\n    Mercy, Mercy, Mercy\n    Spanjazz\n    Bluesette\n    A Taste of Honey\n    Blues Theme, No.2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7989f7721b18c1346e150f93702fc2ac18144f86","amp;dn":"Lenny+Breau+-+The+Velvet+Touch+of+Lenny+Breau%3A+Live%21+%281969%29+%5B199","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7989f7721b18c1346e150f93702fc2ac18144f86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,137,247,114,27,24,193,52,110,21,15,147,112,47,194,172,24,20,79,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
