By carrying life-cycle analysis from the narrow field characterizing\nconventional product assessment to the much broader field of systems assessment,\na number of new challenges are encountered, both regarding the impacts\nto include in the study and also with respect to the technical approach to\nfollow. The book attempts to give a systematic overview of these problems and\ntheir solution, both with the aim of serving as a textbook at university level and\nalso as a reference work for engineers, economists or environmental scientists\nand administrators, whether on a local or a national level, in need of life-cycle\nassessment insights as a part of their work.\n\nFor classroom use the methodology chapters may form the basis for lectures,\nwhile the chapters dealing with case studies may be used as discussion papers\nand material for exercises suited for treatment in study groups, which could be\nfocused on construction of one or more local scenarios.\n\nThe basis drawn upon for the presentation has two components: on the\nmethodological side, work performed for the OECD (Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development) and its sister organisation IEA\n(International Energy Agency) has been used, together with material derived\nfrom projects performed for various United Nations organisations (the environmental\nprogramme, UNEP, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange, IPCC). On the application side, projects have been carried out for the\n12th Directorate of the European Commission (the project Externalities of\nEnergy of the JOULE Programme and a scenario project under the APAS/\nRENA programme), and last but not least for the Danish Energy AgencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nEnergy Research Programme, which financed a life-cycle analysis of bothcurrent and future Danish energy systems. Participants in all the projects are\nthanked for interesting discussions over the years.\n\nThe present book constitutes a complete rewriting of an earlier account by\nBernd Kuemmel, Stefan KruÃ‚Â¨ ger Nielsen and Bent SÃƒÂ¸rensen, furnishing here\ndetailed discussion of a wealth of new applications based on work from the\nrecent decade. The methodology chapters of course have many sections only\nlightly updated from the earlier version. After all, theory is not supposed to\nchange too much with time.\n\nAt the end of the book there is a Glossary of words and concepts, giving\nexplanations of important terms, followed by references, units and conversion\nfactors, and an index.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e54ca323cca61f88117c88b30591688183aa752","amp;dn":"Life-Cycle+Analysis+of+Energy+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e54ca323cca61f88117c88b30591688183aa752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,84,202,50,60,202,97,248,129,23,200,139,48,89,22,136,24,58,167,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
