Cleverly, I used the license.dat file from one of the many Windows copies online and off I was, ready to computer the area of a sombrero or find a function that closely resembles a Hershey kiss. \n\nIt works for me.\n\nI made the zip file with stuffit.\n\nSo, here's the instructions to install since it isn't an actual install file and I forgot to include a text file.\n\nCopy the 'Maple 12' folder to you applications folder.\n\nCopy the 'Maple.frameworks' folder to hard drive whatever it's called/Library/Frameworks\n\nThe cracked license file is already in the right folder (inside Maple.frameworks). \n\n\nAlso, I'm gonna do my best to stay online as long as I can...no sooner than 10 people who uploaded. My campus blocks p2p so if you don't seed, then it's your damn fault","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed65faacad8b27507b7c52306700f4ce8b8b57f","amp;dn":"Maple+12+for+Mac+%28Use+this+one%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed65faacad8b27507b7c52306700f4ce8b8b57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,214,95,170,202,216,178,117,7,183,197,35,6,112,15,76,232,184,181,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
