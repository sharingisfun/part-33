New Old Story abounds with likable new approaches to well-trod subject matter. The main Ã¢â‚¬ËœstoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ here seems to be the allure and excitement of the rambling musical life on one hand and its costs back at home on the other. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not familiar with the band (formed in 1995) yet, their name might deceive you. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound much like Cash, nor do they have the punk or Americana leanings suggested by the willingness to scare off good Christian folks by starting their band name with a mild curse. They are, in fact, a brawny roadhouse honky tonk band doing stuff not unlike what you could have heard on Hal Ketchum or Dwight Yoakam records during the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s. That makes them wildly out of step with whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening on mainstream radio today, of course, a fact they take as a point of pride: The vigorous, freewheeling Ã¢â‚¬Å“No Honky TonksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mourns the demise of real country music and real country venues from California to Texas and Oklahoma (whose Red Dirt is Ã¢â‚¬Å“just rock and roll to me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Stuart hazards). ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that restless desire to keep thoughtful, traditional country music alive that keeps the boys Ã¢â‚¬Å“Highway BoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where the album starts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and ultimately leads to the kind of staring down of consequences at home exemplified by its final chapter, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bounds of Your Heart.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In between, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lovely, textured mix of guitars, banjo, Dobro, fiddle, mandolin, pedal steel, piano, and more, comprising a full arsenal of rootsy country goodness. Combined with StuartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solid songs and pliable voice Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he can sound as pissed off and dangerous as Jamey Johnson or as smooth as Lyle Lovett, as needed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this is one new old story worth hearing again and again.\n\n\n[/color][/b]\n\n\n\n[url=http://musicemporium.Caster.fm] Visit my Radio Website [/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acd4fa7f34f160ac674bd67a15ea205251f6197","amp;dn":"Bastard+Sons+of+Johnny+Cash+-+New+Old+Story+%5B2013%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1acd4fa7f34f160ac674bd67a15ea205251f6197","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,205,79,167,243,79,22,10,198,116,189,103,161,94,162,5,37,31,97,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
