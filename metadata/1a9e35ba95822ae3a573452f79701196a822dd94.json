Just put greenluma files in steam folder and quit steam (if already running) then start greenluma.exe\n\nSo using greenluma you have unlocked automatically BBA and Ripper Mod, not Ryder (which is not yet coded)\n\nFor those that already have game and are applying this as an update, your savegames won't be lost, because steam_appid.txt is not included and won't change your appid when you overwrite all. Also read the included .txt files for more info.\n\nIf you want to play alone without requiring steam or greenluma (but you cannot play coop this way) then you need to use the file named &quot;steam_api.DLL-forSINGLEPLAYER_noSTEAMrequired&quot; just rename that as steam_api.dll it's the 16kb one, your savegames will be stored in out folder under game folder, if you later decide to play coop, it will be tricky to transfer your savegames into the steam folder where savegames are stored when playing coop version of the .dll (which is the default)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9e35ba95822ae3a573452f79701196a822dd94","amp;dn":"Dead+Island+Bloodbath+Arena+only+aka+update+7+of+23+November+201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9e35ba95822ae3a573452f79701196a822dd94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,158,53,186,149,130,42,227,165,115,69,47,121,112,17,150,168,34,221,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
