A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balian's father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king\n\nCast Info\nCast: \nOrlando Bloom, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Philip Glenister, Kevin McKidd, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Marton Csokas, Alexander Siddig, Michael Sheen, Eva Green\n\nGeneral Info\nFormat: AVI\nFile Size: 1.30 GiB\nOverall Bitrate: 1 338 Kbps\nDuration: 2h 18mn\n\nVideo Info\nContainer: XVID\nVideo Bitrate: 1 198 Kbps\nResolution: 640 X 360 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.208\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: BD5/BD9\n\nAudio Info\nAudio Codec: MPEG Audio (MP3)\nBitrate Mode: Constant\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nChannel Count: 2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dcdf68a45d1864d720cc90d3fd185dc2cce6676","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Of+Heaven+DVDRip+%5BWD99%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dcdf68a45d1864d720cc90d3fd185dc2cce6676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,205,246,138,69,209,134,77,114,12,201,13,63,209,133,220,44,206,102,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
