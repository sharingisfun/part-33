Thanks to a large population of baby boomers, muscle car and V8 culture is starting to boom again in New Zealand. NZV8 is not only riding that wave, but leading the way by providing world class magazine that features the cars, events and people that make the scene so exciting.  NZV8 covers an extensive range of high-performance V8-engine vehicles. Wherever the local ground shakes to the beat of a tuned eight-cylinder machine, NZV8 is part of the action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea37a5e435f5118096b7a6280a9c122136459c6","amp;dn":"NZV8+-+March+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea37a5e435f5118096b7a6280a9c122136459c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,163,122,94,67,95,81,24,9,107,122,98,128,169,193,34,19,100,89,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
