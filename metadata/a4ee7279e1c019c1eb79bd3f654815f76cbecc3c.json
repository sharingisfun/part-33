The album features songs penned by Kirsty and an \nall-star list of country writers whose recent credits include the likes of Bon \nJovi, Carrie Underwood, Jessica Simpson and Rascal Flatts. It was once again \nproduced by Graham Thompson whose credits include hit albums by James \nBlundell, Adam Brand, Melinda Schneider &amp; The Sunny Cowgirls.\n\nKirsty Lee Akers may stand a mere 148cm (4 feet Ten inches) tall\nbut donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be misled by her diminutive size. She is brimming with talent and the \nright kind of attitude.\n\n&quot;I've put my heart and soul into making this album. I have been totally honest \nin my song writing so the songs reflect my life and the things that have \nhelped me grow as an artist and a young woman. I hope from listening to this \nalbum people will get to know me a little bit more and enjoy listening to it as \nmuch as I did making it!&quot; \n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ee7279e1c019c1eb79bd3f654815f76cbecc3c","amp;dn":"Kirsty+Lee+Akers+-+Better+Days+%5B2009%2FVBR190%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ee7279e1c019c1eb79bd3f654815f76cbecc3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,238,114,121,225,192,25,193,235,121,189,63,101,72,21,247,108,190,204,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
