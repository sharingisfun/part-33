Mass spectrometry has many uses, both qualitative and quantitative, from analyzing simple gases to environmental contaminants, pharmaceuticals, and complex biopolymers. The extraordinary versatility can make mass spectrometers daunting to novices. Consequently, new users would benefit greatly from an understanding of the basic concepts as well as the processes that occur in these instruments. Mass Spectrometry for the Novice provides exactly that, with detailed, straightforward descriptions and clear illustrations of principles of operations and techniques.\n\nThe book begins with an overview that includes essential definitions and then provides information on the components of and the strategies used in the most common instruments. The authors discuss the methodologies available, classes of compounds analyzed, and the types of data that can be generated. A group of representative applications from published articles is summarized, demonstrating the diversity of mass spectrometry. The authors also condense the essentials of the topic into one invaluable chapter that provides a set of concise take-home messages on all aspects of mass spectrometry. The final section provides a collection of resources including books, reviews, and useful websites.\n\nUsing simple language, new color figures, clever cartoons, and assuming no prior knowledge, this book provides a readily understandable entrÃƒÂ©e to mass spectrometry. A CD-ROM with selected figures and cartoons is included.\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\n\nJohn Greaves is director of the Mass Spectrometry Facility in the Department of Chemistry, University of California, Irvine. He received his BSc in zoology and genetics from Leeds University in 1975 and a PhD, on the pharmacology of the antimalarial Primaqiune, from Liverpool University/Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in 1979. On moving to the United States, he spent five years at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and seven years at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, where he was involved with cancer and environmental research, respectively. He moved to the University of California, Irvine in 1992 where he has been particularly interested in the use of open access mass spectrometry to enable scientists lacking experience in the technique facilitate their research by obtaining mass spectrometric data rapidly, on a 24/7 basis. He has more than 80 publications.\n\nJohn Roboz is a professor in the Department of Medicine (Div. Hematology/Medical Oncology), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. He holds a BS degree (1955) from Eotvos University, Budapest, Hungary, and MS (1960) and PhD (1962) degrees in physical chemistry from New York University. In 1969, he joined the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as an associate professor and became a professor in 1980. His research interests have been the development of mass spectrometric techniques for new antineoplastic agents and their application in collaborative studies with basic scientists and clinicians. Dr. Roboz has more than 135 publications. His first book, Introduction to Mass Spectrometry: Instrumentation and Techniques (Wiley, 1968) was reprinted in 2000 by the American Society for Mass Spectrometry in the Classic Works in Mass Spectrometry series. His second book, in 2002, Mass Spectrometry in Cancer Research (CRC Press), won a commendation award from the British Medical Association.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/crclarge/978142009/9781420094183.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/crclarge/978142009/9781420094183.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1abd00d9c7a11d8086f0098e1a7c75c275dafdec","amp;dn":"Mass+Spectrometry+for+the+Novice+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1abd00d9c7a11d8086f0098e1a7c75c275dafdec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,189,0,217,199,161,29,128,134,240,9,142,26,124,117,194,117,218,253,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
