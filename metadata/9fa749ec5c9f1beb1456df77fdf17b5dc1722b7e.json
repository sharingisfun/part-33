(I can&amp;#039;t assure it will be problem free, but I try)\n\nIf something goes wrong, uninstall (one at a time, damn you EA &gt;.&lt;) and start over.)\n\n(SEED)\n\n1. Extract all the archive files. Google for 7-zip and download and install it if you don&amp;#039;t have anything to do this with. (7-zip seems to be less troublesome than winrar)\n\n2. Run Autorun.exe in the folder with (01) in it and install. Keys are listed below. Proceed on to (02) and so forth. (Read next step for (02) though)\n\n3. To install University (02) you will need to mount cd 2 as virtual cd using a program like daemon tools* (see end of file for help with daemon tools). Google for daemon tools if you need this (it&amp;#039;s free). If you&amp;#039;re lazy or this is just too complicated for you, you can skip it. You will still be able to play the game; you just won&amp;#039;t have university, which is a pretty cool expansion.\n\n(KEEP SEEDING)\n\n4. After installing all 15, run the patch called sims2ep6_patch.exe and sims2ep7_patch.exe\n\n5. After installing all expansions and the patch copy Sims2EP7.exe from the crack folder in the freetime folder and paste it into your TSBin directory of the freetime install (delete Sims2EP7.exe that?s in there first).\n\nNote: If you ever install a patch you may have to redo (and find a new version of) the crack. I suggest gamecopyworld.com for cracks.\n\n6. Run the shortcut for Freetime and enjoy. (You don&amp;#039;t need cracks for the stuff packs, only the newest expansion pack. When you run the stuff pack shortcuts it just tells you to run the one for the latest expansion pack &gt;.&lt; A+ to EA for that.)\n\nFYI: When you first run the game, give it a good 5 minutes to load (not including the video) before you decide it?s broken. After that first time it should load much faster.\n\n(DON&amp;#039;T STOP SEEDING)\n\nThe correct order of installation is as follows:\n\nThe Sims 2\n  9DMD-H4H3-PT2R-7EKC-V74A\n\nUniversity\n  QL22-Q976-4X8J-QMHX-22PB\n\nNightlife\n  (already installed with sims 2)\n\nHoliday (Christmas) Party Pack\n  No CD Key Needed\n\nOpen for Business\n  BPY8-4ZD4-LHYW-S57F-UZEK\n\nFamily Fun Stuff\n  F4EN-XDGJ-8HWJ-F8HV-MRLD\n\nGlamour Life Stuff\n  RYZ9-29RJ-A8J9-E1R0-1911\n\nPets\n  AHNW-MG5V-XBOX-LRLD-RULE\n\nHappy Holiday Stuff\n  No CD Key Needed\n\nSeasons\n  6DRZ-F33C-CWL4-TDL7-4UR6\n\nCelebration Stuff\n  JWW6-SSJQ-5LAN-T5LA-SRLD\n\nH&amp;M Fashion Stuff\n  68JA-SRST-VR32-4LPW-9HGA\n\nBon Voyage (INSTALLER DOES NOT DEFAULT TO ENGLISH)\n  1PH9-2Q1J-1111-G111-1FLT\n\nTeen Style Stuff (INSTALLER DOES NOT DEFAULT TO ENGLISH)\n  JL7X-25B6-Q4SF-8Q4S-KRLD\n\nFreetime (INSTALLER DOES NOT DEFAULT TO ENGLISH)\n  57V5-UBIB-B52K-BFA5-2VTY\n\nKitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff (INSTALLER DOES NOT DEFAULT TO ENGLISH)\n  H8JA-8LRD-7THY-5YCO-HFLT\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nÃ‚Â·\t1.3 Ghz processor (2.0 for Vista) \nÃ‚Â·\t512 MB RAM (1GB for Vista) \nÃ‚Â·\tWindows(R) Vista, Windows XP, Windows ME, Windows 98 or Windows 2000 Operating System. \nÃ‚Â·\t8x or faster CD/DVD drive \nÃ‚Â·\tAt least 1.5 GB of additional hard drive space (5.0 GB total is required if installing both The Sims 2 and The Sims 2 Bon Voyage Expansion Pack at the same time.) 11 GB for every expansion and stuff pack.\nÃ‚Â·\tA T&amp;L-capable video card with at least 32 MB of video RAM. \nSupported video cards:\nÃ‚Â·\tATI Radeon(TM) series 8500 or better (9600 or greater required for Vista)\nÃ‚Â·\t8500, All-In-Wonder 8500 \nÃ‚Â·\t9000, 9200, 9500, 9600, 9700, 9800 \nÃ‚Â·\tX300, X600, x700, X800, x850 \nÃ‚Â·\tX1300, X1600, X1800, X1900, X1950 \nNVIDIA(R) Quadro(TM) series\nQuadro, Quadro2, Quadro4\n\nNVIDIA GeForce series GeForce2 GTS and better (GeForce 6200 or greater required for Vista)\nÃ‚Â·  GeForce 2, 2 GTS \nÃ‚Â·  GeForce 3, 3 Ti \nÃ‚Â·  GeForce 4, 4 Ti, 4200, 4600, 4800, MX 420, 440, 460 \nÃ‚Â·  GeForce FX 5200, 5500, 5600, 5700, 5800, 5900, 5950 \nÃ‚Â·  GeForce PCX 5300, 5900 \nÃ‚Â·  GeForce 6200, 6600, 6800 \nÃ‚Â·  GeForce 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 7950 \nÃ‚Â·  S3 GammaChrome \nÃ‚Â·  S18 Pro \nÃ‚Â·  S18 Ultra Intel(R) Extreme Graphics (see note below)\n82865, 82915 and above\n\nNOTE: If you have a non-T&amp;L capable video card, such as Intel Extreme Graphics, then you need at least a 2.4 GHz processor.\n\n*How-to on daemon tools: Install daemon tools, you&amp;#039;ll have to reboot, and then finish installing. If the installer doesn&amp;#039;t pop up after you reboot, just run it again and you won&amp;#039;t have to reboot this time. After it&amp;#039;s done installing, right click on the icon in your system tray, go to Virtual CD/DVD Rom, pick Device 0, and click mount image. Then find the image you want to mount and hit open, and then it will be just like you put that cd in your cd drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa749ec5c9f1beb1456df77fdf17b5dc1722b7e","amp;dn":"The+Sims+2+all+expansions+%28april+15+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa749ec5c9f1beb1456df77fdf17b5dc1722b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,167,73,236,92,159,27,235,20,86,223,119,253,241,123,93,193,114,43,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
