The film is based on a story by Richard H. Landau and Daniel Mainwaring and stars Charles McGraw, Joan Dixon, Lowell Gilmore, Louis Jean Heydt and Milburn Stone.\n\nOne of noirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadly recipes is present in Roadblock. Diane suffers from a brazen materialism that drives her to make immoral and ultimately destructive choices, while her suitor is so sexually repressed that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do anything to get into her pants. Put simply: she has to have jewels and furs, he has to have her Ã¢â‚¬â€ and crime is the only way for them both to get what they want. That first night in the motel, after flipping a coin for the bed, they consummate their destiny with a portentous good night exchange:\n\nDiane: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some day you are going to want something nice and expensive that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford on a detectiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s salary.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nJoe: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Like what?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nDiane: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Like me. Good night.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRoadblock is a well-paced true film noir. The fatalistic story has a few nice touches in addition to the two lead performances including a slick opening credit sequence and a decent (but generic) film score. \n\nI consider Roadblock to be Charles McGrawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best film noir. RKOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s B-movie alternative to Robert Mitchum was certainly in better crime thrillers. The Narrow Margin for one is today considered a classic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it is. Before becoming a leading man, McGraw appeared as a supporting actor in a slew of films like the great T-Men and The Killers. I never doubted McGrawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acting ability Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I always enjoyed in everything he was in.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 679mb\nDuration.... 01:13:21\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 704\nFrame Height.... 396\nData Rate.... 1160kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23 F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
