Patrick O'Brian's brilliantly detailed narrative reunites them in a breathtaking chase through stormy seas and icebergs south of Cape Horn, where the hunters suddenly become the hunted. &quot;The pleasures of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels defy enumeration...These are books that offer the reader both sensual and intellectual enjoyment, the pleasures of immensely stylish writing as well as the pleasures of engagement with an author who is moralist, naturalist, and naval historian into the bargain.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf60b715d8ac852c817ef0cf98fda8281e65acb","amp;dn":"Wine-Dark+Sea%2C+The+-+Patrick+O%5C%27Brian-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf60b715d8ac852c817ef0cf98fda8281e65acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,246,11,113,93,138,200,82,200,23,239,12,249,143,218,130,129,230,90,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
