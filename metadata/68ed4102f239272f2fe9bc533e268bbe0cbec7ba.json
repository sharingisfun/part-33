Although he is a poet, he is unable to secure any employment. One day he meets with Jyoti (Vyjayanthimala) and both fall in love. After their marriage, there is considerable resentment, and Jyoti's brother, Shekar (Ashok Kumar) refuses to have to do anything with Jyoti. When Shekar offers money to Deepak, Deepak refuses to accept it. Shekar and Jyoti's dad, Daya Shankar (Badri Prasad) sympathises with Jyoti and wants her to be the sole heir to his property after his death. In the meantime, Om Prakash marries his son to a wealthy woman, who does bring in a lot of dowry, but refuses to do any household work, and instead puts her father-in-law to work.
