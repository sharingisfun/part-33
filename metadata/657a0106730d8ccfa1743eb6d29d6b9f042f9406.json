This is the second out of three LPs put out by Frehley in the 1980s, but the last under the band name Frehley's Comet.\n\nSecond Sighting was recorded with new drummer Jamie Oldaker, who had previously worked with Bob Seger and Eric Clapton. He replaced Anton Fig, who would return for 1989's Trouble Walkin'. This makes Second Sighting the only Frehley solo album or project (excluding compilations) to not feature Fig.\n\n&quot;Dancin' With Danger&quot; is a cover version of a song recorded by the Canadian band Streetheart. Although the songwriting credits list Frehley and Dana Strum, the music and lyrics are very similar to the original version. Sequencer programming was done by Gordon G.G. Gebert.\n\n&quot;Insane&quot; and &quot;It's Over Now&quot; were released as singles with corresponding music videos. Both singles failed to chart.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Track listing\n    2 Personnel\n    3 Charts\n    4 References\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLead vocals \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Insane&quot;   \tAce Frehley, Gene Moore \tFrehley \t3:45\n2. \t&quot;Time Ain't Runnin' Out&quot;   \tTod Howarth \tHowarth \t3:52\n3. \t&quot;Dancin' With Danger&quot;   \tFrehley, Dana Strum, Spencer Proffer, Streetheart \tFrehley \t3:25\n4. \t&quot;It's Over Now&quot;   \tHowarth \tHowarth \t4:39\n5. \t&quot;Loser in a Fight&quot;   \tHowarth, John Regan \tFrehley, Howarth \t4:33\n6. \t&quot;Juvenile Delinquent&quot;   \tFrehley \tFrehley \t5:13\n7. \t&quot;Fallen Angel&quot;   \tHowarth \tHowarth \t3:44\n8. \t&quot;Separate&quot;   \tFrehley, Regan \tFrehley \t4:56\n9. \t&quot;New Kind of Lover&quot;   \tHowarth \tHowarth \t3:14\n10. \t&quot;The Acorn Is Spinning&quot;   \tFrehley, Regan \t(Instrumental) \t4:50\nPersonnel\n\n    Ace Frehley - guitars, lead and backing vocals\n    Tod Howarth - guitars, keyboards, lead and backing vocals\n    John Regan - bass guitar, backing vocals\n    Jamie Oldaker - drums\nIt was good and Frehley is still relevent in Rock'n Roll See Space Invader.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:657a0106730d8ccfa1743eb6d29d6b9f042f9406","amp;dn":"Ace+Frehley+-+Second+Sighting+%28Frehleys+Comet%29+mp3+192k++ak61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"657a0106730d8ccfa1743eb6d29d6b9f042f9406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,122,1,6,115,13,140,207,161,116,62,182,210,157,107,159,4,47,148,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
