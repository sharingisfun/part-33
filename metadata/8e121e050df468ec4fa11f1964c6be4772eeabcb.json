His only hope lies far to the west, where a powerful water elemental is rumored to dwell. Along the way, he joins forces with the Wild Elves, who were once his enemy. They alone can lead him through the dangers of the Wildlands. \n\nTogether, they must journey to a mysterious land of eternal spring and return before the kingdom is overrun by evil. Far to the south, a vile sorcerer will stop at nothing to take control of all the lands of Nol'Deron. \n\nHe has devised a method to bind the souls of living beings, transforming them into beasts who will serve as his army. With an entire kingdom at his disposal, he is ready to make his war against Na'zora and begin his conquest of the world. A classic tale of good vs. evil in a world of magic and adventure.\n\nGenre: Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e121e050df468ec4fa11f1964c6be4772eeabcb","amp;dn":"A+Story+Of+River+by+Lana+Axe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e121e050df468ec4fa11f1964c6be4772eeabcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,18,30,5,13,244,104,236,79,161,31,25,100,198,190,71,114,238,171,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
