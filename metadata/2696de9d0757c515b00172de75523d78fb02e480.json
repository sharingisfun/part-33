While some speed gain\nis possible even in single processor mode, best results\nare achieved in multi-core environment\n**********************************************************************************\nSpeed gain depends on data type and average file size\nSeveral cores are utilized more efficiently when compressing\nlarge files\nb) we had to increase memory requirements to achieve higher\ncompressionGeneral RAR compression algorithm allocates\nabout 120 MB comparing to 40 MB in WinRAR 4.11;\nc) RAR text compression algorithm cannot utilize several CPU cores\nefficiently, so its performance in multiprocessor environment\nis much lower than for general algorithm. Also its decompression\nspeed is much lower than in general algorithm regardless of\nCPU number. So we decided to disable the text algorithm by default\n***********************************************************************************\nIf you need maximum possible compression ratio for plain text data\nregardless of speed, you can enable the text compression\nin &quot;Advanced compression parameter&quot; dialog. Press &quot;Compression...&quot;\nbutton on &quot;Advanced&quot; page of archiving dialog to access it\nYou can also change this option permanently in default compression\nprofile;\n*********************************************************************************\nFastest&quot; (-m1) compression mode also supports several processor\ncores now. In 4.11 it could use only a single processor core\nRAR general decompression algorithm speed is slightly improved\nthough not to same extent as RAR compression. RAR decompression\nis not able to use several processor cores, so its performance\ndoes not depend on a number of cores\n*********************************************************************************\nChanges in ZIP compression:\n**********************************************************************************\nnow ZIP compression supports several processor cores resulting\nin noticeably higher performance in multi-core environment\nSingle CPU ZIP compression is also faster than in 4.11;\nmemory use for ZIP compression is increased to about 15 MB\n\nVersion: 4.20\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Execute the WinRAR 4.20 Final (32-bit)(2-click run)(registred).exe file.\n2. Click next.\n3.
