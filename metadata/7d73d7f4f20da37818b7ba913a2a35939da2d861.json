It is the only UK No. 1 single for the band to date, in spite of the fact that it received very little airplay on the BBC. Like most songs from the No Prayer for the Dying album, &quot;Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter&quot; was rarely played live following the supporting tour, No Prayer on the Road, with the band only performing it on selected dates in 1992 and 2003.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot; (Bruce Dickinson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:42 (7&quot; &amp; 12&quot;)\n    &quot;I'm a Mover&quot; (Free cover) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:26 (7&quot; &amp; 12&quot;)\n    &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; (Led Zeppelin cover) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:42 (12&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d73d7f4f20da37818b7ba913a2a35939da2d861","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Bring+Your+Daughter+To+The+Slaughter+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d73d7f4f20da37818b7ba913a2a35939da2d861","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,115,215,244,242,13,163,120,24,183,186,145,58,42,53,147,157,162,216,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
