After his twin dies in an accident, strange things happen to Jerry at a dizzying pace: a fortune shows up in his bank account, weapons are delivered to his flat, and a voice on his cell phone tells him the police are on their way. Jerry follows the voice's instructions, and soon he and a woman he's never met are racing through the city, on to a plane, and eventually to the Pentagon, chased by the FBI. She is Rachel Holloman, a single mom; the voice has threatened her son's death if she doesn't cooperate. The voice seems to know everything. Who is behind it, what is being planned, and why Jerry and Rachel?\n\nCodec: MPEG-H Part2/HEVC (H.265) (hevc)\nResolution: 1920x800\nDisplay resolution: 1920x800\nFrame rate: 23.975988\nDecoded format: Planar 4:2:0 YUV\n\nStream 1\nCodec: DTS Audio (mp4a)\nLanguage: English\nChannels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 1536 kb/s\n\nStream 2\nCodec: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)\nLanguage: English\nDescription: Surround\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nBits per sample: 16\nBitrate: 1536 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42815459dbc9b627b1d2e2e9c97beb6ca53809a0","amp;dn":"Eagle+Eye%282008%29H265.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42815459dbc9b627b1d2e2e9c97beb6ca53809a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,129,84,89,219,201,182,39,177,210,226,233,201,123,235,108,165,56,9,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
