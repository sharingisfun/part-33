YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll begin this class in ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pose.\n\nTravis encourages everyone to take a few moments before starting to relax while setting intentions, such as cultivating patience, peace, optimal health, energy, etc. Focus then turns to the breath, with Travis encouraging practitioners to listen to the &quot;river of the breath&quot; and fuse this rhythm with the mind so they become one. He also suggests breaks if practitioners require them, as ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pose is &quot;always there&quot; when needed.\n\nThe yoga class gets going with Tabletop Pose, also called Cow Pose. This pose strengthens the neck and front torso in addition to providing the spine and stomach organs with gentle massage.\n\nJoin Travis on this hour-long journey and enjoy melting from one yoga pose to the next knowing youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing your body (and your mind!) a huge favor!\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nStyle: Power, Vinyasa\nFocus: Cardio, Super Sweaty Flow, Strength\n\nVideo; x264; 1280*720 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 23.976 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7138be46b79a7358478ae4e3dd59b77c10561cfc","amp;dn":"Travis+Eliot+Yoga+-+Cross+Train+60+min+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7138be46b79a7358478ae4e3dd59b77c10561cfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,56,190,70,183,154,115,88,71,138,228,227,221,89,183,124,16,86,28,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
