One of the more remarkable aspects of his musical shape shifting is that these style changes occur naturally and without pretense. Instead of chasing the next big sound, Walker instead flips the calendar back years (if not decades) and uses the past for inspiration. Having dabbled in arena rock, singer/songwriter fare, glam rock and alt-country up until now, Walker has yet again shed his musical skin on his sixth solo full-length. The Spade, recorded with his loosely collected backing band the Black Widows, finds Walker entrenched in a set of raucous, raw rock thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more concerned with fun than perfection. The high points are among the most fun songs WalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recorded: album opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBodegas And BloodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features a sing-songy guitar line thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible not to mimic; lead single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummer Of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢89ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ simultaneously nicks the melody of Dixie ChicksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoodbye EarlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and graciously tips its cap to Bryan AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ seminal hit; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBullet Belt,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ like many of WalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs, relays the singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scrappy hair-metal days.\n\nWalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo output has been nothing if not consistently strong over the years, but The Spade isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t perfect. While the band hit the mark more often than not, the snarly, bratty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvery Single Body ElseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and sultry, sinewy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSweetheartsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are dead weight; the natural inclination is to hit the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œskipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ button and speed to the far-superior tracks that follow each number. But the real highlight is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSynthesizers,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a keyboard-heavy anthem that dips a toe into honky-tonk delight and puts WalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s keen -Ron Paul 2012 - sense of self-awareness and critical eye full center. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t name my band after an animal/I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have any feathers or neon clothes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he proudly declares, before rhetorically asking, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor once in your life, wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you do what feels right/Instead of waiting on the next big compromise?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ At age 41, Walker has seen the trends come and go. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even been a part of themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½something he readily admits. But where other acts might look for ways to enact some revisionist history, WalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never shied away from his past mistakes. Instead, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s learned to look back and just laugh. Perhaps thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made his solo work so endearing over the years; in a scene where everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so damn serious, Walker prefers to take it all with a grain of salt. If only more acts would follow suit.\n\nFacebook Page for the fans ! :\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab030f1a9905edea4804621810cffea53f5518c","amp;dn":"Butch+Walker+and+the+Black+Widows+-+The+Spade+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab030f1a9905edea4804621810cffea53f5518c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,176,48,241,169,144,94,222,164,128,70,33,129,12,255,234,83,245,81,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
