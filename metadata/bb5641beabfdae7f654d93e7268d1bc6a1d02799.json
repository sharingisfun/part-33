Topics include chloroplast-derived antibodies, biopharmaceuticals and edible vaccines, production of antibodies in plants and plant cell suspension cultures, production of spider silk proteins in plants, and glycosylation of plant produced proteins. The whole is rounded off by chapters on the demands and expectations made on molecular farming by pharmaceutical corporations and the choice of crop species in improving recombinant protein levels.\r\nOf interest to biotechnologists, gene technologists, molecular biologists and protein biochemists in university as well as the biotechnological and pharmaceutical industries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb5641beabfdae7f654d93e7268d1bc6a1d02799","amp;dn":"Molecular+Farming+-+Plant-made+Pharmaceuticals+and+Technical+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb5641beabfdae7f654d93e7268d1bc6a1d02799","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,86,65,190,171,253,174,127,101,77,147,231,38,141,27,198,161,208,39,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
