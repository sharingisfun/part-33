It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7122fd65d43dbfc6c9df41580504bd514e1f144a","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7122fd65d43dbfc6c9df41580504bd514e1f144a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,34,253,101,212,61,191,198,201,223,65,88,5,4,189,81,78,31,20,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
