The Challengers impressive articulated wheel arrangement made it one of the most successful large steam locomotive designs ever developed and was considered to be one of the most technologically advanced of its kind, providing both high horsepower and efficient operations.\n\nTheir mammoth weight made the Challenger a regular sight on UPs heavy mountainous freight routes but they were also put into service on the occasional passenger service through mountain territories to California and Oregon. In total, 252 Challengers were built between 1936 and 1943 by the American Locomotive Company and Baldwin Locomotive Works, just less than half for UP.\n\nThe Union Pacific Challenger V2.0 for Train Simulator is available in two liveries - the famous Union Pacific black livery and Union Pacific lined grey livery. Key features include TSX effects, new smoke and steam particle emitters, and enhanced cab interior.\n\nThe\nSherman Hills Add-On\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7820657/Train_Simulator_2013_-_Sherman_Hill&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7820657/Train_Simulator_2013_-_Sherman_Hill&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(available on TPB) is required to play the scenarios included with this Add-On.\n\nScenarios\nFour scenarios for the Sherman Hill route:\n\nChallenger Intro Run\nChallenger on Sherman Hill Cheyenne to Laramie\nChallenger Working at Wycon\nChallenger Working the BNSF Stub\n\n\nKey Features\nUnion Pacific Challenger in Union Pacific black and lined grey liveries\nRealistic cab interior and sounds\nImproved locomotive physics and TSX effects\nRealistic raindrops and correct headlight illumination\nNew smoke and steam particle emitters\nQuick Drive compatible\n\nHow to Install:\n\nTrain Simulator 2013 (Will only work with a cracked edition)\nIn the game folder (&quot;...
