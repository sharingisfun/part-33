Unlike many zombie stories, We Will Bury You does not focus on the main characters' struggle to survive when besieged by a horde of zombies. Instead, the story concentrates on the lovers' relationship and their travels as the roles of women in society change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9908a9c736477ee89a2f1ce8a3f246d8874cf933","amp;dn":"We+Will+Bury+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9908a9c736477ee89a2f1ce8a3f246d8874cf933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,8,169,199,54,71,126,232,154,47,28,232,163,242,70,216,135,76,249,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
