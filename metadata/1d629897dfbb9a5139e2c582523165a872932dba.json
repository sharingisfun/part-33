The &quot;power&quot; seeps into everything they do, from their original music to their live shows. The epitome of power blues is Hurricane Ruth herself. Ruth is a captivating performer, who will grab your attention from note one and never let you go! Willie Dixon once told Ruth &quot;she was the only hurricane he could appreciate&quot;.\nHurricane Ruth LaMaster started performing professionally in 1979, and found instant success. She acquired the name Hurricane Ruth from the fact that no one believed that such a large sound could come out of such a small woman! Ruth has performed with Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra, Adrian Belew, and Louis Belson. Ruth has opened for John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, Willie Dixon, Taj Mahal, Ramsey Lewis Trio, Sam &amp; Dave, and Fenton Robinson. Ruth is joined by David Lumsden (lead guitar), Gary Davis (bass guitar), and Jim Engel (drums). Hurricane Ruth is a &quot;power&quot;ful blues experience that you won't soon forget!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d629897dfbb9a5139e2c582523165a872932dba","amp;dn":"Hurricane+Ruth+-+The+Power+Of+The+Blues...Feels+Like+A+Hurricane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d629897dfbb9a5139e2c582523165a872932dba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,98,152,151,223,187,154,81,57,226,197,130,82,49,101,168,114,147,45,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
