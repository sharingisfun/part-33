Jackie&amp;#039;s fondness towards his silent screen movie heroes like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin is apparent as he plays the bungling oaf who wins through in the end. A miss at the box office when first released, it has only been since his style of comedy action has won him over millions of fans, that today&amp;#039;s audience can appreciate the magic and genius of Jackie Chan.\n\nCast: \nJackie Chan (Sing Lung), Doris Lung (Chun Erh), Dean Shek Tin, James Tin Jun, Gam Ching Lan, Miu Tin, Lee Man Tai, Kam Kong, Wu Ma, Lee Hoi Lung, Li Min Lang, Lee Chi Lun, Peng Kong, Ko Keung, Gam Sai Yuk \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.530716/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.530716/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecbe9ca54370635a3d0350cb612c323e34f4ec80","amp;dn":"%5BKung+Fu%5D+Half+A+Loaf+Of+Kung+Fu+%28Jackie+Chan%2C+1978%29+EN+-+Rmvb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecbe9ca54370635a3d0350cb612c323e34f4ec80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,190,156,165,67,112,99,90,61,3,80,203,97,44,50,62,52,244,236,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
