Starting as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n\n\n\nIf you can afford,please visit \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ae70bdc0301114cabd5c94e755136f7a426aa80","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+09+April+2012+-+PDF.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ae70bdc0301114cabd5c94e755136f7a426aa80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,231,11,220,3,1,17,76,171,213,201,78,117,81,54,247,164,38,170,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
