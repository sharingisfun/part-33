The character debuted in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963), and was created by writer-editor Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby.\n\nBorn Anthony Edward Stark, and usually called Tony, he is an industrialist playboy and ingenious engineer who suffers a severe heart injury during a kidnapping in which his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. He later uses the suit to protect the world as Iron Man. Through his multinational corporation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Stark Industries ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Tony has created many military weapons, some of which, along with other technological devices of his making, have been integrated into his suit, helping him fight crime. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology and business in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have gradually removed the Cold War themes, replacing them with more contemporary concerns such as corporate crime and terrorism.\n\n\nIron Man Armors\n\nIron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). Other people who have assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend James Rhodes; close associates Harold &quot;Happy&quot; Hogan; Eddie March; and (briefly) Michael O'Brien.\n\nThe weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years, but Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his gauntlets. Other weapons built into various incarnations of the armor include: the uni-beam projector in its chest; pulse bolts (that pick up on kinetic energy along the way; so the farther they travel, the harder they hit); an electromagnetic pulse generator; and a defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating ultra-freon (i.e., a freeze-beam); creating and manipulating magnetic fields; emitting sonic blasts; and projecting 3-dimensional holograms (to create decoys).\n\nIn addition to the general-purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized suits for space travel, deep-sea diving, stealth, and other special purposes. Stark has modified suits, like the Hulkbuster heavy armor. The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability enough to engage the Incredible Hulk in a fight. A later model, designed for use against Thor, is modeled on the Destroyer and uses a mystical powersource. Stark also develops an electronics pack during the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technologies, will burn-out those componentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½rendering the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models, however. While it is typically associated with James Rhodes, the War Machine armor also began as one of Stark's specialty armors.\n\n\n\n\nAudio/Video\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Invincible Iron Man 720p Ita Eng.mkv \nFormat : Matroska \nFile size : 2.44 GiB \nDuration : 1h 19mn \nOverall bit rate : 4 374 Kbps \nEncoded date : UTC 2010-06-13 09:32:06 \nWriting application : mkvmerge v3.3.0 ('Language') built on Mar 24 2010 17:29:03 \nWriting library : libebml v0.7.8 + libmatroska v0.8.1 \nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3e765759567e720d100f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 5 frames \nMuxing mode : Container profile=&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fbae959095948c95bbc8d5ca&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC \nDuration : 1h 19mn \nBit rate : 2 329 Kbps \nNominal bit rate : 2 256 Kbps \nWidth : 1 280 pixels \nHeight : 720 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nOriginal frame rate : 23.976 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nColorimetry : 4:2:0 \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.101 \nStream size : 1.30 GiB (53%) \nWriting library : x264 core 61 r957 7ce0f2c \nLanguage : English \n\nAudio #1 \nID : 2 \nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 1h 19mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 448 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 6 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nVideo delay : 1s 0ms \nStream size : 255 MiB (10%) \nLanguage : Italian \n\nAudio #2 \nID : 3 \nFormat : DTS \nFormat/Info : Digital Theater Systems \nCodec ID : A_DTS \nDuration : 1h 19mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 1 510 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 6 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nResolution : 24 bits \nStream size : 861 MiB (35%) \nLanguage : English \nText \nID : 4 \nFormat : UTF-8 \nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8 \nCodec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text \nLanguage : English \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b25fa7d350b1151a8c45580f08d7549989121ee2","amp;dn":"The+Invincible+Iron+Man+%5BBDrip+720p+ac3+Ita+dts+Eng%5D+nautilus-bt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b25fa7d350b1151a8c45580f08d7549989121ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,95,167,211,80,177,21,26,140,69,88,15,8,215,84,153,137,18,30,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
