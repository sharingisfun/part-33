Then we'll create a script that keeps track of how many coins we've collected and how to update the UI for the player. After that, we'll learn how to properly create a UI system that will update the proper data.\n\nTo wrap up the training, we'll learn how to reward the player with an extra life once they've collected all of the coins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b41b797262156078650c487ab510fd51f4b1b3","amp;dn":"Creating+Collectible+Items+for+2D+Games+in+Unity+-+Digital+Tutor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b41b797262156078650c487ab510fd51f4b1b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,180,27,121,114,98,21,96,120,101,12,72,122,181,16,253,81,244,177,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
