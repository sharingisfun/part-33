Written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, it was released on the album Argybargy, received positive critical reviews, and charted in the United Kingdom and Canada. Squeeze has since included the song in their concert setlists and compilation albums.\n\n&quot;Another Nail in My Heart&quot; is two minutes and fifty-five seconds long. It was written by Squeeze members Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, and it was produced by John Wood and Squeeze. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it a &quot;nervy breakup tune.&quot; In his review of the song, Stewart Mason wrote, &quot;The topic, as usual, is a cocktail of lost love and heavy drinking, culminating in the memorable chorus 'And in the bar, the piano man found another nail from my heart.'&quot;\n\n&quot;Another Nail in My Heart&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. The song has been called a &quot;piece of pop mastery&quot;, a &quot;pop classic of the new wave era&quot;, and an &quot;ingenious pop-rock confection&quot;. John M. Borack wrote that it &quot;made great use of Difford and Tilbrook's signature high register / low register harmonies.&quot; Allmusic's Stewart Mason wrote that &quot;it's one of Squeeze's finest singles, marrying one of Glenn Tilbrook's most memorably McCartneyesque melodies to a typically wry and clever Chris Difford lyric.&quot; The New York Times' Jon Pareles cited it as one of Squeeze's &quot;catchiest&quot; songs.\n\nSqueeze are a British band that came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the New Wave period of the late 1970s, and continued recording successfully in the 1980s and 1990s. They are known in the UK for their hit songs &quot;Cool for Cats&quot;, &quot;Up the Junction&quot;, &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Labelled With Love&quot;, &quot;Black Coffee In Bed&quot;, &quot;Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)&quot;, and &quot;Hourglass&quot;. Though not quite as commercially successful in the U.S., &quot;Tempted&quot;, &quot;Hourglass&quot; and &quot;853-5937&quot; were all American chart hits for Squeeze, and the band have a dedicated following there and continue to attract new fans. All of Squeeze's hits were written by band members Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford. \n\nThe group formed in Deptford, London in 1975, and first broke up in 1982. Squeeze then reformed in 1985, and broke up again in 1999. The band reunited for tours through the United States and United Kingdom in 2007, and this touring version of Squeeze has continued into the present day. \n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2012, Difford and Tilbrook confirmed that they would be recording an album of new material for release in 2013.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Nail_in_My_Heart&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Nail_in_My_Heart&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaocOAaeB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kaocOAaeB&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:01\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
