This was the first ripper/encoder I messed with. The offset of my CDROM was not applied for the rip.\n\nI used CUETools to apply the proper offset, verify each file, and generate an AccurateRip/CTDB log. This log is included.\n\nI'm new to this.  Please comment and tell me if I'm doing anything right or wrong.
