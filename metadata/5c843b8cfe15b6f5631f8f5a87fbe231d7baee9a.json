Thomas Holland (Chapman &amp; Hall, CRC, 2003).pdf\n\nISBN 1584883200\n\nMATLABÃ‚Â®, now the industry-standard engineering language for computation, analysis, and visualization, continues to evolve in its capabilities. Version 6.x incorporated several major improvements, including significant enhancements to its graphics features, such as transparencies, increased 3-D visualization, and an improved rendering engine.\n\nThe bestselling Graphics and GUIs with MATLAB has been fully revised to reflect MATLAB version 6. The third edition also features a number of improvements in both content and organization that ensure its readers get the optimum level of detail and best possible instruction.\n\nNew in the Third Edition:\n\nFull updates that reflect MATLAB 6.x enhancements\nExpanded discussions on 2-D and 3-D graphics\nNew chapters on good GUI design and data visualization techniques\nVolume visualizations\nUpdated language commands\nDeeper coverage of programming techniques, such as data structures and callback techniques\nExercises in each chapter\nAdditional examples and updated illustrations \n\nGraphics and GUIs with MATLAB, Third Edition retains the comprehensible, almost conversational tutorial style that made its predecessors so popular but offers a streamlined organization and deeper coverage that make this edition an even better way to acquire or increase proficiency in using MATLAB to its fullest graphics capabilities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c843b8cfe15b6f5631f8f5a87fbe231d7baee9a","amp;dn":"Graphics+and+GUIs+with+MATLAB%26reg%3B+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c843b8cfe15b6f5631f8f5a87fbe231d7baee9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,132,59,140,254,21,182,245,99,31,143,90,135,251,226,49,215,186,238,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
