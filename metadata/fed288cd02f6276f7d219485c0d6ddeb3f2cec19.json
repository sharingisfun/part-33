But something about the man they called Subject Thirteen got her involved. The scientists said he was a devil, and they had a decent case: Terrifying power. A bad attitude. And looks that could lead anyone to sin. . .\n\nCain O'Connor knows the minute he catches her candy scent that Eve could drive him wild. But she's a threat--in a way no one has been for him in years. She's safer away from him, too. But with a powerful conspiracy determined to shut Eve up for good, there's no time to argue. All they can do is trust their instincts--and their hearts. . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed288cd02f6276f7d219485c0d6ddeb3f2cec19","amp;dn":"Burn+For+Me+%28Phoenix+Fire+%231%29+by+Cynthia+Eden.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fed288cd02f6276f7d219485c0d6ddeb3f2cec19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,210,136,205,2,246,39,111,125,33,148,133,192,214,221,235,63,44,236,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
