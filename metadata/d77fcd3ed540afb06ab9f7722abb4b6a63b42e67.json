Unlike the archival concerts that have popped up in The Bootleg Series, Brandeis University 1963 isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a major statement. At seven songs, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brief and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no mythology behind the show; a recording wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even known to exist until a tape was found within the collection of music critic Ralph J. Gleason in 2009.\n\nIt may be minor, but as a live recording of Dylan between the release of his debut and The FreewheelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Bob Dylan, it is certainly noteworthy, a glimpse of Dylan working folk festival bills unencumbered by fame or legend. \n\nHe chooses topical songs for his two sets, bypassing Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Hard RainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A-Gonna FallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“BlowinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in the WindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in favor of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Masters of War,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“TalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ John Birch Paranoid Blues,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of Hollis Brown,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“TalkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ World War III Blues,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ material that accentuates the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roots in May of 1963. Dylan is in good form, open and sometimes skirting on the edge of being lively, never quite revealing that it was slightly risky to entertain a festival audience with a collection of originals previously unheard by the crowd. If the show doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite manage to be memorable, it is certainly engaging, a worthwhile 38 minutes even if it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite have much more than a historic hook to warrant repeated plays.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
