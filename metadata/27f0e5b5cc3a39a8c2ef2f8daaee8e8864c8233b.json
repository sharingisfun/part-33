At the heart of their chilling scenario is their contention that the plague was spread by direct human contact (not from rat fleas) and was, in fact, a virus perhaps similar to AIDS and Ebola. Noting the periodic occurrence of plagues throughout history, the authors predict its inevitable re-emergence sometime in the future, transformed by mass mobility and bioterrorism into an even more devastating killer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27f0e5b5cc3a39a8c2ef2f8daaee8e8864c8233b","amp;dn":"Return+of+the+Black+Death+-+The+World%5C%27s+Greatest+Serial+Kille","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27f0e5b5cc3a39a8c2ef2f8daaee8e8864c8233b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,240,229,181,204,58,57,168,194,239,47,141,170,238,142,136,100,200,35,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
