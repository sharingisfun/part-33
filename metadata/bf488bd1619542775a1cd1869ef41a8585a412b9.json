The newest fad, &quot;MEK&quot; (short for Massive Enhancement Culture), involves adding cybernetic implants, such as cell phones implanted directly into the skull. The founder of the MEK movement is Sarissa Leon, who has become a celebrity of the new fad. She returns to Sky Road, the place where MEK first took off, after learning of the murder of her former lover and fellow MEK pioneer R.J. Coins. Leon discovers that Sky Road is now the center of &quot;bad MEK&quot;, which involves implanting black market weapons and stolen military technology. Leon attempts to find Coins' murderer, while trying to clean up Sky Road.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf488bd1619542775a1cd1869ef41a8585a412b9","amp;dn":"Warren+Ellis+mek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf488bd1619542775a1cd1869ef41a8585a412b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,72,139,209,97,149,66,119,90,28,209,134,158,244,26,133,133,164,18,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
