I think that is the way that sould have been. One good and long movie, with just the book and nothing else. The way Tolkien wanted the story is the way that is supposed to be.\nYou will see how much faster the movie seems and how much Bilbo is in evidence. You will also notice how little we have of Legolas, Thranduil, Bard, Borg and nothing on Tauriel, Galadriel, Saruman, Sauron and Radasgast.\nI also added 2 scenes from the extendend edition of the second movie because these are scenes from the book. The Gandlaf introduction to Beorn and Bombur sleeping on Mirkwood.\nI believe my edition is the best on out there.\nPlease comment and share with your friends.\n\nThanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b8dba61080586244e07fe4a5bfee62660a7f915","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit+-+Book+Version+-+3h47m+%282015%29+BrRip+x264+-+dimitreze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b8dba61080586244e07fe4a5bfee62660a7f915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,141,186,97,8,5,134,36,78,7,254,74,91,254,230,38,96,167,249,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
