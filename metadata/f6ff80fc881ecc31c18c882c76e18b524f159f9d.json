It is work in progress. Menu and decision rooms will be improved in next patches.\nWork in progress menu background.\nWORK IN PROGRESS MENU BACKGROUND.\n\nGAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFixed morale being too fragile in some cases. Solid lines will be kept more easily now for more realistic and enjoying battles.\nFixed AI being too cautious, especially the Ã¢â‚¬Å“DeterminedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ AI. AI should be much more active overall in all characters when it has to be.\nIncreased and noticeable differentiation per AI character, for example the Balanced AI will desire to make wider flanking attacks than before.\nFixed AI merging its units too much in some cases. AI should make now much more tidy lines and formations.\nIncreased projectile range of cavalry so to keep more distance from enemy.\nReduced firepower of 24pdr howitzers of Confederate Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ battery because it was able to inflict in average 500+ casualties to enemies very easily.\nImproved melee mechanics and damage, especially cases in which soldiers were slowed down too much.\nBalanced overall gameplay mechanics and US/CS combat power for increased challenge and realism.\nFixed retreat direction issues. Also retreated units are not having so much self-defense so will not rout other units or may do with much less probability.\nIncreased possible delay time for 2nd/3rd phases of 1st day battles. This was needed to provide the necessary tactical decision for player and AI, to press the attack on Cemetery Hill or wait for next day.\n\nTEXT/CAMPAIGN BATTLE FLOW\n\nVarious battle flow fixes for battles of the third day that had more than 2 objectives. In some occasions they gave wrong defeat message.\nFixed battle flow error where you fought for the right flank as CS having captured Cemetery Hill sector and in next battle you lost it.\n\nBUG FIXES\n\nFixed save error that could cause freeze and game instability.\nFixed AI related factor that could produce freeze/lag moments in systems with very high fps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ff80fc881ecc31c18c882c76e18b524f159f9d","amp;dn":"Ultimate+General+-+Gettysburg+v.0.845+cracked+3dm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ff80fc881ecc31c18c882c76e18b524f159f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,255,128,252,136,30,204,49,193,140,136,44,118,225,139,82,79,21,159,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
