It concentrates on the portion of C++ that will be most useful to a mathematician. While developing the necessary tools and syntax of C++, the book presents example programs relevant to interesting and somewhat sophisticated mathematical problems. The reader can proceed as far as he/she wants. Even just reading the first few chapters of the book and writing some programs using the constructs introduced, there is sufficient [material] for many purposes within undergraduate mathematics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The strength of this book is the intermingling of interesting mathematics with the ideas and syntax of the C++ language. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The writing is very fluent and does not bog down in endless detail as so many programming books do ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ In summary, I recommend this book highly to frustrated mathematicians wishing to learn C++ programming. You will really enjoy the well-chosen examples and the light touch in the exposition.\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jeffrey Nunemacher, MAA Reviews\n\n For problems that require extensive computation, a C++ program can race through billions of examples faster than most other computing choices. C++ enables mathematicians of virtually any discipline to create programs to meet their needs quickly, and is available on most computer systems at no cost. C++ for Mathematicians: An Introduction for Students and Professionals accentuates C++ concepts that are most valuable for pure and applied mathematical research.\n\n This is the first book available on C++ programming that is written specifically for a mathematical audience; it omits the languageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more obscure features in favor of the aspects of greatest utility for mathematical work. The author explains how to use C++ to formulate conjectures, create images and diagrams, verify proofs, build mathematical structures, and explore myriad examples. Emphasizing the essential role of practice as part of the learning process, the book is ideally designed for undergraduate coursework as well as self-study. Each chapter provides many problems and solutions which complement the text and enable you to learn quickly how to apply them to your own problems. An accompanying CD ROM provides all numbered programs so that readers can easily use or adapt the code as needed.\n\n Presenting clear explanations and examples from the world of mathematics that develop concepts from the ground up, C++ for Mathematicians can be used again and again as a resource for applying C++ to problems that range from the basic to the complex.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8978060b4e2eefb06f99351d7c67035a33b9f161","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+for+Mathematicians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8978060b4e2eefb06f99351d7c67035a33b9f161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,120,6,11,78,46,239,176,111,153,53,29,124,103,3,90,51,185,241,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
