This set of information tells you how.\n\nSome notes:\n* This setup may be anonymous, however you will have to use the torrent tracker(s) that is on I2P as this is the network we will be using.\n\n* Speeds can be a bit slower than you are used to. The best way to solve this is to get as many people as you know to use I2P and share their bandwidth. The more bandwidth shared, the faster everything will be. I2P is still way faster than Tor.\n\n* Don't be shy, check out the sites on I2P. You may find many interesting things.\n\nNOTE: This torrent may be updated as needed to improve its content.\n\n\nSharing of information and knowledge is our duty. Without the free sharing of knowledge and information, the world will become one big rock full of idiots.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f7a0a5a1665844cf1778de050d98923f8c03043","amp;dn":"How+to+share+files+via+Torrent+anonymously","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f7a0a5a1665844cf1778de050d98923f8c03043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,122,10,90,22,101,132,76,241,119,141,224,80,217,137,35,248,192,48,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
