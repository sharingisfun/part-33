Montgomery&amp;#039;s rather fanciful conclusion that Market Garden was &quot;90% successful&quot; was hardly supported by the facts. The operation was an unmitigated failure. This episode, from the landmark television series Battlefi eld, features fascinating archive footage from all over the world. The program includes a review of the political and military situation before the battle, portraits of leaders and commanders, an explanation of weapons and tactics, and the story of the battle itself. Vivid graphics place the battle into the context of the war as a whole.  \n\n\nApprox run time: 1 hr, 45 min. NTSC, Color &amp; B&amp;W, Dolby Stereo. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af53f9b4ee821cb10d2ac9d98f987e04229bbd9d","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Operation+Market+Garden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af53f9b4ee821cb10d2ac9d98f987e04229bbd9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,83,249,180,238,130,28,177,13,42,201,217,143,152,126,4,34,155,189,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
