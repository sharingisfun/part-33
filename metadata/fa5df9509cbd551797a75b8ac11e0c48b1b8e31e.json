The results, a swinging quintet set with pianist Hank Jones, bassist George Duvivier and drummer Clarence Johnston, are quite rewarding. There are two ballad features for the tenor (&quot;How Long Has This Been Going on&quot; and a beautiful version of &quot;My Romance&quot;) and one for Edison (&quot;Embraceable You&quot;) along with three medium-tempo collaborations. Nothing unexpected occurs but the melodic music is quite enjoyable.
