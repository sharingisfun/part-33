The main focus of the book is on food applications, while numerous industrial applications are highlighted as well. The editors and authors, all experts in various bioprocessing fields, cover the latest developments in the industry and provide perspective on new and potential products and processes. Challenges and opportunities facing the bioproduct manufacturing industry are also discussed. Coverage is far-reaching and includes: current and future biomass sources and bioprocesses; oilseed processing and refining; starch and protein processing; non-thermal food processing; fermentation; extraction techniques; enzymatic conversions; nanotechnology; microencapsulation and emulsion techniques; bioproducts from fungi and algae; biopolymers; and biodegradable/edible packaging.\r\n\r\nResearchers and product developers in food science, agriculture, engineering, bioprocessing and bioproduct development will find Food and Industrial Bioproducts and Bioprocessing an invaluable resource","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d482d46b5098e091406cd8ea06bc0e857ee4983","amp;dn":"Food+and+Industrial+Bioproducts+and+Bioprocessing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d482d46b5098e091406cd8ea06bc0e857ee4983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,72,45,70,181,9,142,9,20,6,205,142,160,107,192,232,87,238,73,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
