Abandoned by her mother, she's dropped out of school \nand has been supporting herself as an employee at McDonald's while her \nfather Charlie resides in a mental institution. When Charlie is released \nand sent back to their home, Miranda finds the relatively peaceful \nexistence she's built for herself completely disrupted. Charlie has \nbecome obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish \nexplorer Father Juan Florismarte Garces is buried somewhere near their \nsuburban California housing unit. Armed with a metal detector and a stack \nof treasure-hunting books, Charlie soon finds reason to believe that the \ngold resides underneath the local Costco, and encourages Miranda to get \na job there so that they can plan a way to excavate after hours.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Michael Douglas.\n=&gt;-Evan Rachel Wood.\n=&gt;-Willis Burks II.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Mike Cahill.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Drama : Crime.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2007.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.32 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 028 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 32mn.\n\n=&gt;-King of California.........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/king_of_california/\n=&gt;-King of California.........: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/king-of-california/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1910 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 149 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4c7b668a8db21079327818ef3868b3718449217","amp;dn":"King+of+California+-+Michael+Douglas+Comedy+2007+Eng+Subs+720p+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4c7b668a8db21079327818ef3868b3718449217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,199,182,104,168,219,33,7,147,39,129,142,243,134,139,55,24,68,146,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
