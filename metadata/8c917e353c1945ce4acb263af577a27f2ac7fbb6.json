The conservative Palestinian society does not accept them and very often their own family members murder them because gay men &quot;disgrace&quot; the family or the village. If gay Palestinians seek refuge in Israel, the Israeli authorities consider them enemy aliens and often they are arrested and sent back to the Palestinian territories, where they're murdered. Fortunately there are several brave Israeli judges and Israeli human rights groups that help gay Palestinians be saved.\n\nWhen Nimer, a Palestinian student, sneaks across the border into Tel Aviv he meets Israeli lawyer Roy in a nightclub. Despite an initial hesitation on Nimer's part, the two meet again and quickly fall in love. However, despite their burgeoning romance, the two must face the fact that Nimer is caught between a rock and a hard place - unable to be openly gay in Palestine and unable to live with Roy in Tel Aviv due to the political situation. The two leads are utterly compelling and will leave you wanting the two to succeed despite knowing that, in all likelihood, their romance is doomed.\n\n\nVideo: AVC, 1920Ã‘â€¦1080, 16:9, 7878 Kbps, 25,000 fps\nAudio 1 (Hebrew):  AC3, 2.0 ch, 48000 Hz, 192 Kbps\nAudio 2 (Polish):  AC3, 2.0 ch, 48000 Hz, 192 Kbps\nAudio 3 (Russian):  AC3, 2.0 ch, 48000 Hz, 192 Kbps\n\nSubtitles: Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, English, Greek, Portuguese, \nPortuguese-Brazil, Serbian, Turkish, Vietnamese\n\nDuration: 01:31:30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c917e353c1945ce4acb263af577a27f2ac7fbb6","amp;dn":"Out+in+the+Dark+2012.HDTV.h264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c917e353c1945ce4acb263af577a27f2ac7fbb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,145,126,53,60,25,69,206,74,203,38,58,245,119,162,127,42,199,251,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
