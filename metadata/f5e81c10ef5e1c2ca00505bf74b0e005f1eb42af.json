Both members got their start as part of the U.K. dance outfit Transglobal Underground in the early '90s (specifically their 1993 debut, Dream of 100 Nations and 1994's International Times). By 1996, Sparkes and Dubulah decided to branch out on their own, leading to the formation of Temple of Sound. The duo recruited drummer Terry Neale, vocalist Diva Julianna, and bassist Lina Ikse Bergman, resulting in the release of their independent debut, Black Orchid. In 1999, Sparkes formed the side project Neil Sparkes &amp; Last Tribe, issuing the album Burning Mask the same year. But Temple of Sound regrouped shortly thereafter, and in 2001, released their sophomore effort, People's Colony No. 1, which featured new vocalist Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali (the nephew of legendary qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan) and bassist Jah Wobble, among others. \n\nPEOPLE'S COLONY No 1\n\n1  The Jewelled Heart  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Din, Khan, Khan, Khan, Sparkes, Wobble \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n2  Solar East  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Din, Khan, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n3  Beloved \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Din, Khan, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n4  Tears of Light  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n5  Paradise of Nada  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n6  Garden of Perfume  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Din, Khan, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n7  People's Colony No. 1  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n8  The Palace At 4 AM  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n9  Wheel of Heaven  \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Khan, Khan, Sparkes \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n10  Love Moves the Sun \nComposed by: Count Dubulah, Khan, Khan, Sparkes, Wobble \nPerformed by: Temple of Sound, Rizwan-Muazzam Qawwali,  \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e81c10ef5e1c2ca00505bf74b0e005f1eb42af","amp;dn":"Temple+of+Sound+%26+Rizwan-Muazzam+Qawwali","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e81c10ef5e1c2ca00505bf74b0e005f1eb42af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,232,28,16,239,94,28,44,160,5,5,191,116,176,224,5,241,235,66,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
