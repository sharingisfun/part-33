I went to look online for an audiobook version of the story and found a version that I have included in this torrent.\n\nThe tone was so jarring and harsh, I decided to create my own version which I hope captures the essence of the story.  I did it in the spirit of the movie &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; directed by Spike Jonez.\n\nRecorded on a Nokia 5130 Cell Phone.\n\nIf you like it, you can find me in the ID3 tags of the song file.\n\nIt's the first time I've done this. I'm not the clearest, but I hope you enjoy it.\n\nI do not claim ownership of the material, just my voice as I read it.\n\nThank you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a4f4dd0ea88185cdcb54bc038f1efa9e26b9ab","amp;dn":"Velveteen+Rabbit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a4f4dd0ea88185cdcb54bc038f1efa9e26b9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,164,244,221,14,168,129,133,205,203,84,188,3,143,30,250,158,38,185,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
