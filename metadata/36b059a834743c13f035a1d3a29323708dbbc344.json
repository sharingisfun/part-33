In the week before Jack plans to marry, the pair heads out from Los Angeles to the Santa Ynez wine country. For Jack, the tasting tour is Seven Days to D-Day, his final stretch of freedom. For Miles, who has divorced his wife, is facing an uncertain career, and has lost his passion for living, the trip is a week-long opportunity to evaluate his past, his future, and himself. A raucous and surprising novel filled with wonderful details about wine, Sideways is also a thought-provoking and funny book about men, women, and human relationships.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b059a834743c13f035a1d3a29323708dbbc344","amp;dn":"Sideways+audiobook+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b059a834743c13f035a1d3a29323708dbbc344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,176,89,168,52,116,60,19,240,53,161,211,162,147,35,112,141,187,195,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
