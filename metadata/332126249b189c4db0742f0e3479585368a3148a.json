Bach - Piano Concerto No 1 In D Minor BWV 1052\n\nThe Clavier Concerto in D minor, BWV 1052, is believed to be based on an earlier violin concerto, a supposition supported by some of the figuration. Music from the concerto appeared in 1728 as the introductory sinfonia to Cantata No.188, Ich habe meine Zuversicht, and the first two movements, the second with an added choral part, were used about the same time for the Easter Cantata No.146, Wir mÃƒÂ¼ssen durch viel TrÃƒÂ¼bsal. The concerto boasts an energetic first movement, a heart-felt G minor aria, over a repeated bass pattern in the slow movement and a virtuoso final Allegro.\n\n\n1. I. Allegro\n2. II. Adagio\n3. III.

Schuman composed the pieces with the characters Florestan and Eusebius in mind, representing the duality of his personality. Eusebius depicts the dreamer in Schumann while Florestan represents his passionate side. These two characters parlay with one another throughout the collection, ending self-reflectively with Eusebius in Ende vom Lied. The individual pieces' names and keys are as follows:\n\n\n1. Des Abends (The Evenings) in D-flat major / Sehr innig zu spielen (Play very intimately)\n2. Aufschwung (Soaring) in F minor / Sehr rasch (Very rapidly)\n3. Warum? (Why?) in D-flat major / Langsam und zart (Slowly and tenderly)\n4. Grillen (Whims) in D-flat major / Mit Humor (With humor)\n5. In der Nacht (In the Night) in F minor / Mit Leidenschaft (With passion)\n6. Fabel (Fable) in C major / Langsam (Slowly)\n7. Traumes Wirren (Dream Visions; lit. Dream's Confusion i.e. Tangled Dream) in F major / Auberst lebhaft (Extremely vivace)\n8. Ende vom Lied (End Of The Song) in F major / Mit gutem Humor (With good humor)\n\n\n\n\nRobert Schumann - March for piano in G minor (Sehr kraftig), Op. 76/2\n\n1. March for piano in G minor (Sehr kraftig), Op. 76/2\n\n\n\n\nRobert Schumann - Waldszenen, Op. 82\n\nSchumann's Waldszenen (Forest Scenes), Op. 82 (1848-49) consists of nine short pieces similar in style and spirit to the composer's Kinderszenen (1838). &quot;Eintritt&quot; (Entrance) features unusual, asymmetrical phrasing. &quot;Jager auf der Lauer&quot; (Hunter in Ambush) is an exciting, technically challenging piece in the cast of a typical nineteenth century hunting song. The difficulties of &quot;Einsame Blumen&quot; (Solitary Flowers) lie in maintaing balance between the two distinct voices in the right hand; otherwise, it is simple and melodic. &quot;Verrufene Stelle&quot; (Haunted Spot) evokes an air of eerie mystery with passages in slow dotted rhythms, while the fast, tricky triplets of &quot;Freundliche Landschaft&quot; (Friendly Landscape) create a surprisingly poetic effect. &quot;Herbege&quot; (At the Inn) presents a variety of material that requires great sensitivity to balance.\n\nThe best-known and most striking piece of the set is &quot;Vogel als Prophet&quot; (The Prophet Bird); its cross-relations, incomplete melodies, and extreme delicacy of texture create a weirdly beautiful atmosphere. &quot;Jagdlied&quot; (Hunting Song) is the second of the Waldszenen in this style and the example more typical of the genre. Rapidly repeated triplet chords both lend the piece rhythmic drive and pose a substantial technical challenge. The concluding &quot;Abschied&quot; (Farewell) is a touching song without words. Waldszen may rightly be regarded as Schumann's last really fine keyboard work. The diminishment of the composer's mental and emotional capacities in ensuing years led him to redirect his energies largely toward the compilation and revision of earlier works rather than the production of new music.
