This album was originally \nreleased as Joni Mitchell because the LP album covers were printed incorrectly, \ncutting off part of the &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot; title (spelled out by birds in flight). \nThe cut off as well as the publishers at Reprise Records not noticing the birds \nspelled out the album name, caused the eponymous album title...\n\n   1.
