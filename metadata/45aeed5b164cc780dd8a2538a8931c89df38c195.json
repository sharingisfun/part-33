Turns out it's not The Blob paying her a visit via shower drain, it's something else entirely. No matter what you call it, leaking black inky stuff from your person is probably bad.\n\n\nDetails\n********\n\nDirector:Russell Mulcahy\nWriters:Jeff Davis (developer), Jeff Davis, and 4 more credits Ã¢â€Â¬Ã¢â€¢â€”\nStars:Tyler Posey, Crystal Reed and Dylan O'Brien \nGenres:Comedy | Drama | Horror | Thriller \nCountry:USA\nLanguage:English\nSubs:External Greek Subs \nRelease Date:5 June 2011 (USA)\nseason complete with 12 Episode\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45aeed5b164cc780dd8a2538a8931c89df38c195","amp;dn":"Teen+Wolf+S02E01+HDTV+x264-ASAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45aeed5b164cc780dd8a2538a8931c89df38c195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,174,237,91,22,76,199,128,221,138,37,56,168,147,28,137,223,56,193,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
