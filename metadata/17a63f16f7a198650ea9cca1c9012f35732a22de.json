A true Dr. Funkenstein-type creation, an all-star ensemble called The Truth is a brand new band comprised of some of the baddest musicians imaginable, each a heavyweight in his own right. Everybody here has a bulletproof rep and has gigged with or is a member of one high-power entity or another.\n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the lineup: St. Paul Peterson (The Time, The Family): bass, vocals, keyboards, guitar; Kip Blackshire (Prince): vocals, keys, guitar; Chance Howard (Prince): keys, vocals; Odell (Mint Condition): guitar, vocals; Jellybean Johnson (The Time, The Family): guitar; Jerry Hubbard (The Time, Jesse Johnson): bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals; Eric Leeds (Prince, The Family): saxophone; Donnie LaMarca (St. Paul, Giorgia, Ann Nesby, Jonny Lang): keys, vocals; and Kirk Johnson (Prince): drums, vocals. And then thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the repertoire.\n\nCovers of classic funk (James Brown, Ohio Players, Parliament Funkadelic and such) mixed with jams by the bands these guys came from. Industry know-it-alls told agent-manager Jeff Taube of MidAmerica Talent heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d never even get all these cats together in one room long enough for rehearsal, let alone to sign on as a band. But the determined Taube pulled it off. He explained to me the name they decided on. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen somebodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing is great, guys say itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the truth.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to argue that description doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit this crew?\n\nTracks :\n\n01.
