They brag about their multi-million dollar partnership with the FBI,\nArmy, Navy, NASA, and the Department of Justice, selling out their &quot;skills&quot; to\nthe US empire. So we laid nuclear waste to their systems, owning their pathetic\nwindows box, dropping their databases and private emails, and defaced their\nprofessional looking website.\n\nIn their emails we found various contracts, development schematics, and internal\ndocuments for various government institutions including a proposal for the FBI\nto develop a &quot;Special Identities Modernization (SIM) Project&quot; to &quot;reduce\nterrorist and criminal activity by protecting all records associated with\ntrusted individuals and revealing the identities of those individuals who may\npose serious risk to the United States and its allies&quot;. We also found \nfingerprinting contracts for the DOJ, biometrics development for the military, \nand strategy contracts for the &quot;National Nuclear Security Administration \nNuclear Weapons Complex&quot;.\n\nAdditionally we found login info to various VPNs and several Department of \nEnergy login access panels that we are dumping *live* complete with some URLs \nto live ASP file browser and upload backdoors - let's see how long it takes for \nthem to remove it (don't worry we'll keep putting it back up until they pull \nthe box ;D)\n\nBefore we begin the drop, a personal message to the employees of IRC Federal:\n\nIf you place any value on freedom, then stop working for the oligarchy\nand start working against it. Stop aiding the corporations and a government \nwhich uses unethical means to corner vast amounts of wealth and proceed \nto flagrantly abuse their power. Together, we have the power to change\nthis world for the better.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps \nto perpetuate it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nProps to our black hat and antisec comrades: bantown, dikline,\nh0no, phrack high council, ~el8 and all you kick-ass motherfuckers\nwe've never even heard of. Thank you.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6624c35fc349e6602df3c517c4e4784de77219a7","amp;dn":"Fuck+FBI+Friday+II%3A+IRCFederal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6624c35fc349e6602df3c517c4e4784de77219a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,36,195,95,195,73,230,96,45,243,197,23,196,228,120,77,231,114,25,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
