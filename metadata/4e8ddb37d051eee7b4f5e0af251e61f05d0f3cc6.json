This episode doesn't feature the Doctor or any of his companions. It was written as sort of a primer for the 12-part serial The Daleks Master Plan.\n\n0303 - The Myth Makers - Loose Cannon reconstruction\n0304 - The Daleks Master Plan - Loose Cannon Reconstruction\n\n0305 - The Massacre of St.Bartholomews Eve - Loose Cannon Reconstruction (Quality of this one is lower than the other reconstructions, resolution is lower, 512x384 and the soundtrack isn't as clean). \n\n0306 - The Ark - Australian Digital Broadcast (ripped by 1551)\n0307 - The Celestial Toymaker - Loose Cannon Reconstruction\n0308 - The Gunfighters - Australian Digital Broadcast (ripped by 1551)\n0309 - The Savages - Loose Cannon Reconstruction\n0310 - The War Machines - DVD Rip\n0401 - The Smugglers - Loose Cannon Reconstruction\n0402 - The Tenth Planet - VHS Rip of Parts 1-3.
