Within three months they had formed a group calling themselves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The SonicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and gave their first live performance during an interval spot at the Youth Club.\nOver the next few years various members came and went, then in 1967 the line up of Barry Mayger , Rick Foster, Peter Hewson, and Mick Russell felt it was time for a change of name, and Barry came up with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Chicory TipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Within three years they landed a recording contract with CBS. During this time Mick, the drummer, got married and moved to Wales, and was replaced by Brian Shearer\nAlthough their first two singles were played on BBC Radio 1, it was their third release that made it into the top 100 singles chart, and Chicory Tip performed for the first time on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Top Of The PopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/09/24/vanessa-peters-2/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0823b8d7871ecd504f2c3efdc8bd1d823d79ea19","amp;dn":"Chicory+Tip...The+Singles+Collection%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0823b8d7871ecd504f2c3efdc8bd1d823d79ea19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,35,184,215,135,30,205,80,79,44,62,253,200,189,29,130,61,121,234,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
