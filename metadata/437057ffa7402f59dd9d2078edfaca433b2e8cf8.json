Their work is marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, \ninnovative album art, and elaborate live shows. Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful \nand influential rock music groups of all time. They have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, \nincluding 74.5 million certified units in the United States. The band were inducted into the Rock and \nRoll Hall of Fame in 1996. Since then they have continued to enjoy worldwide success.\n\nMeddle is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. It was released in October 1971.\n\nThe album was recorded at a series of locations around London, including Abbey Road Studios. With no material \nto work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised a series of novel experiments which \neventually inspired the album's signature track, &quot;Echoes&quot;. Although many of the group's later albums would be \nunified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical \ncontributions from each member.\n\nMeddle was produced between the band's touring commitments, from January to August 1971. It was well-received \nby music critics upon its release, but despite being commercially successful in the United Kingdom, lacklustre \npublicity on the part of their US label led to poor sales there.\n\n\n\n   1.
