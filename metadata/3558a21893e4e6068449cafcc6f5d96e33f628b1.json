And, of course, the drugs. \nBut after crashing in a suffocating cloud of cocaine, crystal meth, and heroin, Aerosmith rose up from the ashes to become clean and sober -- and reclaim their rightful title as World Champion Rockers. Learn how they did it in a book that is pure Aerosmith unbound: where they came from, what they are now, and what they will always be -- a great American band. [/color]\n\nWalk This Way is divided into two &quot;books&quot;, or sections of the book, with five chapters apiece. Book One chronicles the band from the primary members' early lives up until 1975, when their album Toys in the Attic was released and the band was reaching their peak in the 1970s. Book Two chronicles the band from 1976 into their downfall in the early 1980s, and then their remarkable comeback of the late 1980s up until 1997, when the book was released.\nThe book is written in a very distinctive fashion, with alternating paragraphs of recollections by the individual band members, band personnel, family members, friends, and music industry professionals. This results in a very descriptive reading, as it presents the detailed recollection of individual events in the band's history from several perspectives\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nStephen Davis is an American music journalist and historian.\nDavis was born in New York City and attended Boston University.
