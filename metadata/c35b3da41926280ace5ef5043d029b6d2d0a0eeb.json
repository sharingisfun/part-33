In Conceptual Physics, Tenth Edition Paul Hewitt shows how a compelling book and the most advanced media can be integrated to empower professors as they bring physics to life for non-science majors, both in and out of class. For the Tenth Edition, Hewitt helps readers connect physics to their everyday experiences and the world around them, and provides additional help on solving mathematical problems. HewittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is famous for engaging readers with analogies and imagery from real-world situations that build a strong conceptual understanding of physical principles ranging from classical mechanics to modern physics. With this strong foundation, readers are better equipped to understand the equations and formulas of physics, and are motivated to explore the thought-provoking exercises and fun projects in each chapter. The new edition features a fresh new design, content that is more focused on physics applications, and updated pedagogical features.\n\nKey Topics: About Science, NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s First Law of Motion: Inertia, Linear Motion, NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Second Law of Motion: Force and Acceleration NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Third Law of Motion: Action and Reaction, Momentum, Energy, Rotational Motion, Gravity, Projectile and Satellite Motion Atomic Nature of Matter, Solids, Liquids, Gases and Plasmas, Temperature, Heat and Expansion, Heat Transfer, Change of Phase Thermodynamics, Vibrations and Waves, Sound, Musical Sounds, Electrostatics, Electric Current, Magnetism, Electromagnetic Induction, Properties of Light, Color, Reflection and Refraction, Light Waves, Light Emission, Light Quanta, The Atom and the Quantum, Atomic Nucleus and Radioactivity, Nuclear Fission and Fusion, Special Theory of Relativity, General Theory of Relativity, Appendices\n\nIntended for those interested in learning the basics of conceptual physics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35b3da41926280ace5ef5043d029b6d2d0a0eeb","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics%2C+10th+Edition+%5BPaul+G.+Hewitt%5D+%7BCharm-Quark%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35b3da41926280ace5ef5043d029b6d2d0a0eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,91,61,164,25,38,40,10,206,94,245,4,61,2,155,109,45,10,14,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
