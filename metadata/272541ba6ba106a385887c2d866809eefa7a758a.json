Her version of Lucinda WilliamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from 2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got My Own Hell to Raise, remains the definitive version of that song, and this from someone who thought the original couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be bettered. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never heard it, look it up online, right now, and listen. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll wait.\n\n\n\nDolly Parton, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Sinead OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ConnorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when LaVette casts her net, she casts it wide, and more often than not, she manages to transform the song into something utterly newÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½recognizable, but deeper, darker, and often more powerful. Her last record, a 6-song collection of soul standards like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChange Is Gonna ComeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t No SunshineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, was a logical extension of her 40+-year career. \n\n\n\nInterpretations: The British Rock Songbook takes on somewhat different material: a set of classic rockers from the 1960s and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s. Led Zeppelin, the Stones, Traffic, Pink Floyd, the Beatles (collectively and individually, except for JohnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½go figure) and more. This is classic-rock radio fodder, and LaVette shows courage in taking on such venerable tunes and placing her own indelible stamp on the material.\n\n\n\nFor roughly half the tracks, her performances are revelatory. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe WordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is transformed from a bouncy Rubber Soul pop song to a from-the-gut plea. Ringo StarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Come EasyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mines the blues for levels of resonance that the original never had, while ZeppelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ trades PlantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fey chirping for LaVetteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s angsty howl, accompanied by a sexy piano undertone. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhy Does Love Got to Be So SadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, from Layla, brings in horns to point up the funk buried in the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DNA, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Me Be MisunderstoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ lends emotional heft to an overly familiar song by the Animals.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, her reinventions are less successful, perhaps because the originals themselves are so perfect, or maybe because her go-to emotional stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½eyeball-scratching angstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t necessarily the perfect tone for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWish You Were HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNights in White SatinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Both these songs are wistful and contemplative, wearing their darkness and sense of loss gently (well, as gently as Roger Waters could ever manage), and LaVette misfires with her turn-it-up-to-11 emotional intensity. Moreover, her bewildering decision to re-order the verse and chorus of the Pink Floyd song, so that she begins with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow I wish you were hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ before any of the powerful verses that lead up to that punchline, is both mystifying and unsuccessful.\n\n\n\nOther songs, like the Rolling StonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSalt of the EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and TrafficÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo Time to LiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, seem lightweight compared to other picks on the album, or even other songs by the bands themselves. (IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d have loved to hear her take on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDear Mr. FantasyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, for example, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWild HorsesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.)\n\n\n\nThe record closes with a live version of the WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLove Reign OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢er MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, recorded live. It is a fitting bit of bombast to end a record which might have benefited from a bit less of it. But hey, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bettye. No one else sings like she does, as this record once again indisputably proves. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/02/bettye-lavette/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/02/bettye-lavette/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272541ba6ba106a385887c2d866809eefa7a758a","amp;dn":"Bettye+LaVette...Interpretations%3B+The+British+Rock+Songbook%282010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272541ba6ba106a385887c2d866809eefa7a758a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,37,65,186,107,161,6,163,133,136,124,45,134,104,9,238,250,122,117,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
