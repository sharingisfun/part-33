The mobility and flexibility provided by it makes our lives more comfortable and productive. But this comes at a cost Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wireless technologies are inherently insecure and can be easily broken. BackTrack is a penetration testing and security auditing distribution that comes with a myriad of wireless networking tools used to simulate network attacks and detect security loopholes.\n\nBacktrack 5 Wireless Penetration Testing BeginnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide will take you through the journey of becoming a Wireless hacker. You will learn various wireless testing methodologies taught using live examples, which you will implement throughout this book. The engaging practical sessions very gradually grow in complexity giving you enough time to ramp up before you get to advanced wireless attacks.\n\nThis book will take you through the basic concepts in Wireless and creating a lab environment for your experiments to the business of different lab sessions in wireless security basics, slowly turn on the heat and move to more complicated scenarios, and finally end your journey by conducting bleeding edge wireless attacks in your lab.\n\nThere are many interesting and new things that you will learn in this book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ War Driving, WLAN packet sniffing, Network Scanning, Circumventing hidden SSIDs and MAC filters, bypassing Shared Authentication, Cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 encryption, Access Point MAC spoofing, Rogue Devices, Evil Twins, Denial of Service attacks, Viral SSIDs, Honeypot and Hotspot attacks, Caffe Latte WEP Attack, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, Evading Wireless Intrusion Prevention systems and a bunch of other cutting edge wireless attacks.\n\nIf you were ever curious about what wireless security and hacking was all about, then this book will get you started by providing you with the knowledge and practical know-how to become a wireless hacker.\n\nHands-on practical guide with a step-by-step approach to help you get started immediately with Wireless Penetration Testing\n\nWhat you will learn from this book :\n\n-Create a Wireless Lab for conducting experiments\n-Monitor the air and sniff wireless packets\n-Bypass WLAN authentication mechanism\n-Crack WEP/WPA/WPA2 encryption mechanisms\n-Break into a WLAN network using infrastructure flaws\n-Break into a Wireless client such as a laptop\n-Advanced attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks and Evading WIPS\n-Conduct wireless penetration test in a methodical way\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n__________________________   .________\n__    ___/  _____/   _    |   ____/\n  |    | /     ___/  /_   |____   \n  |    |     _    _/   /       \n  |____|  ______  /_____  /______  /\n\n                 /       /       / \n\nHave fun.
