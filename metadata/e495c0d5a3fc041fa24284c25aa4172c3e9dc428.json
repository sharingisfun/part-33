It takes the form of an investigation by a resort promoter and a newspaper editor of the strange death of an Iodo islander turned ecology reporter, who disappears overboard on a trip back to the island. Unfolding in flashback, it relates in mock mythological terms the fate of the island, populated almost entirely by Amazon-like female deep sea divers and their shamans. Atmospheric, ghostly and oneiric, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Freudian mind-boggler, filled with male sexual anxiety, culminating in one of the most shocking copulatory denouements in the movies.\n\nTHE ENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE ENCODED INTO THE VIDEO, YOU JUST NEED TO TURN THEM ON!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e495c0d5a3fc041fa24284c25aa4172c3e9dc428","amp;dn":"Io+Island+%28Iodo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e495c0d5a3fc041fa24284c25aa4172c3e9dc428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,149,192,213,163,252,4,31,162,66,132,194,90,164,23,44,62,157,196,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
