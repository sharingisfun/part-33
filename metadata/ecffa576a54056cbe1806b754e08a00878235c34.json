Low key style with a mix of random everyday events and a police investigation. Filmed in a realist style with some surreal moments.\n\nA series of murders, whose hallmarks are numerous body parts being found around the Province, perplex detectives and leave them with a failed investigation. A former member of the force, sacked for incompetence, takes the initiative and follows a lead.\n\nSlow paced but gripping. We are given insights into the characters' lives, motivations and idiosyncrasies alongside their roles in the unfolding world of the murder investigation. What it lacks in action is made up for in a range of intriguing characters and quirky events.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecffa576a54056cbe1806b754e08a00878235c34","amp;dn":"Black+Coal+Thin+Ice+2014.avi+%2B+English+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecffa576a54056cbe1806b754e08a00878235c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,255,165,118,165,64,86,203,225,128,107,117,78,8,160,8,120,35,92,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
