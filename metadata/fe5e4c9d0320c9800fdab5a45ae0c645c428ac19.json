Ruffin, Francis T.S. Yu, &quot;Fiber Optic Sensors, Second Edition&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 1420053655 | 2008 | PDF | 496 pages | 11,3 mb\n\nThe need for both intrinsic and extrinsic fiber optic sensor technologies continues to grow. To meet the demands of this fast expanding applications-driven market, Fiber Optic Sensors, Second Edition presents both the latest advances in fiber optic sensor technology, such as the application of photonic crystal fibers to fiber optic gyroscopes, and recent application opportunities, including the use of fiber optic sensors as a minimally invasive medical treatment.\n\nThe new edition of this seminal work highlights the development of fiber optic sensors, while providing an overview of current methods for the construction of high-speed and high-capacity fiber optic systems. Two new chapters cover topics such as femtosecond laser illumination inscription and the growing application sector of fiber optic chemical and biological sensors.\n\nAdding significant new material, the book continues to provide a progressive history of each sensor type as well as basic principles and fundamental building blocks for practical applications in the electrical aerospace, defense and manufacturing, smart structure, undersea surveillance, medical, and gas and oil industries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5e4c9d0320c9800fdab5a45ae0c645c428ac19","amp;dn":"Fiber+Optic+Sensors%2C+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5e4c9d0320c9800fdab5a45ae0c645c428ac19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,94,76,157,3,32,201,128,15,218,181,164,90,224,198,69,196,40,172,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
