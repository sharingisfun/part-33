Montana Badlands rancher David Braxton (John McLiam) is a self-made man. Through years of tireless effort and determination, he has transformed his vast and rugged land into a thriving, prosperous empire. So when his livestock, his fortune - and even his family - are threatened by a ruthless horse thief (Nicholson), Braxton takes matters into his own hands. Hiring a sadistic &quot;regulator&quot; (Brando) to track down the outlaw, Braxton intends to liberate the territory from crime... but what he initiates instead is a complex series of events that result in brutality and savagery far beyond anything he ever thought possible. Co-starring Randy Quaid and Harry Dean Stanton, scripted by Thomas McGuane and shot throughout majestic Montana, The Missouri Breaks is every bit as powerful and affecting as its dynamic leading men.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64afbb7c7432d0bf8d689ec0ec06a99ac68a9358","amp;dn":"The+Missouri+Breaks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64afbb7c7432d0bf8d689ec0ec06a99ac68a9358","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,175,187,124,116,50,208,191,141,104,158,192,236,6,169,154,198,138,147,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
