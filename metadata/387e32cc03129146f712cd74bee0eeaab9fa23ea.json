From banter to conspiracy. In the documentary individuals, artists and academics from all over the world share their thoughts about the meaning and purpose of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name from both private and public perspectives. Reasons for changing one's name are explored as the film draws references from history, popular culture and individual experiences.\n\nIn Slovenia the film has been labelled as pornographic and as degenerate art by some of the press close to the government. On the other hand, the director of Slovenian Film Center in his analysis said that the film is not to be judged by politicians, but by film critics and the audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:387e32cc03129146f712cd74bee0eeaab9fa23ea","amp;dn":"My.Name.Is.Janez.Jansa-Mariborchan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"387e32cc03129146f712cd74bee0eeaab9fa23ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,126,50,204,3,18,145,70,247,18,205,116,190,224,238,170,185,250,35,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
