Due to its celebrated co-operation with the Rolling Stones, the Japanese sound-architect Ryuichi Sakamoto and the integration-pioneer Jon Hassell, it was one of the first groups to contribute decisively to the rising popularity of world music in Europe and the USA. After Mahama Konate left in 1990, the group broke up then rejoined a few years later in a slightly modernised version produced by Billy Cobham and Peter Gabriel. After awhile KonatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© began to publish his traditional music under the name Farafina Lili.\nThe 8 musicians, dancers and singers of Farafina conjure up from the tara (talking drum), the tama (a wooden drum whose pitch can be changed under pressure from the arm), the djembe (a drum shaped like a chalice and covered with goatskin), and the balaphone (a forerunner of the xylophone) a glittering fabric of sounds, melodies and rhythms, which have made the group world-famous. Its music mingles features from the mandan tradition of the bambaran griots from Burkina Faso with melodies and rhythms from the neighbouring lands Mali, Niger, Benin and Ghana. The group plays in the tradition of those which for centuries have been accompanying griots (singers and storytellers) in West Africa, and bases its polyrhythmic sound on two balaphones and a set of drums and rattles.\n\n-- extracted from http://www.culturebase.net/artist.php?308\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nTRACKLIST\n01.
