It is a satirical parody of the middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its titular family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and it lampoons many aspects of the human condition, as well as American culture, society as a whole, and television itself.\n\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name.[1] The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987.[2] After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox.\n\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast 415 episodes and is currently in its nineteenth season. The season 18 finale, which aired on May 20, 2007, was the show?s 400th episode, and 2007 marked the 20th anniversary of The Simpsons franchise. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007, and has grossed approximately US$526.2 million worldwide to date.\n\nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 23 Emmy Awards, 26 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time magazine&amp;#039;s December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century&amp;#039;s best television series,[3] and on January 14, 2000 it was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom[4] and the longest-running American animated program.[5] Homer&amp;#039;s annoyed grunt &quot;D&amp;#039;oh!&quot; has been adopted into the English lexicon, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.[6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc0b96138cc1ffb965e69685ac53874919be9893","amp;dn":"THE+SIMPSONS%3A+SEASON+1+-+SEASON+18+-+%5BENG%5D%5B1989-NOW%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc0b96138cc1ffb965e69685ac53874919be9893","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,11,150,19,140,193,255,185,101,230,150,133,172,83,135,73,25,190,152,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
