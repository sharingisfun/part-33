Since the discovery of the scrolls in 1947, researchers from around the world have spent years trying to piece the scrolls together and learn what they say and who wrote them.\n\nLDS Perspectives on the Dead Sea Scrolls features LDS scholars discussing how the scrolls have provided new insights into both Judaism and Christianity and aided the LDS community in understanding their own scriptural tradition and the world from which the scriptures came. \n\n\n*** VIDEO INFO ***\nInput Type : DX50(GVC)\nInput Size : 352 x 240\nOutput Type : YUY2\nOutput Size : 352 x 240\nFrameRate(Frame/sec) : 0.00 (29.97)\n\n\n*** AUDIO INFO ***\nSampleRate(Sample/sec) : 11025\nBitRate(Bit/sample) : 16\nChannels : 2\nKBitRate(KBit/sec) : 23\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a36ca02a794d3f61cfcffc9f1e3b0f3926f5c087","amp;dn":"LDS+Perspectives+on+the+Dead+Sea+Scrolls.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a36ca02a794d3f61cfcffc9f1e3b0f3926f5c087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,108,160,42,121,77,63,97,207,207,252,159,30,59,15,57,38,245,192,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
