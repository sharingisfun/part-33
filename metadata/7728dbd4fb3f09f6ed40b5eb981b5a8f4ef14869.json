The intent of this edit was to collate the best material from the film, dispensing with the unnecessary and often risible plot twists, with a mind to bringing the trilogy to a more natural and coherent conclusion. Although rather short with its run time of 66 minutes, the &quot;Mother Of Tears : Obortis Tenebris&quot; redux should hopefully prove an enjoyable fan edit, continuing the atmosphere of its legendary precursors. The following changes have been made :\n\n* A new and original introduction is presented.\n* Many scenes have been re-sequenced.\n* Almost 40 minutes of unnecessary footage has been deleted.\n* The ludicrous ghost of Sarah's mother [played by Daria Nicolodi] has been completely removed, as has the subplot concerning Sarah's mediumistic experiences.\n* The original ending, which proved to be unsalvageable, has been completely cut, being replaced by an new epilogue voiced by Varelli.\n* The voices of Mater Lacrimarum and her disciples have been altered.\n* Some special effects have been enhanced.\n* The whole film has been recoloured.\n* A completely new musical soundtrack has been compiled, mostly including Goblin's original score and other pieces from Argento's films.\n* A startling new audio mix [featuring re-synched elements and some completely new effects] is presented in DTS 5.1.\n\nVIDEO SPECS\n* MKV Matroska [4.5gb]\n* Original 2.10:1 widescreen ratio\n* Video: h264, HD-720p, 1280x586, 23.976fps\n* Audio 1: new mix 5.1 [DTS lossless 1536kbs]\n* Audio 2: new mix 2.0 [AC3 192kbs] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7728dbd4fb3f09f6ed40b5eb981b5a8f4ef14869","amp;dn":"MOTHER+OF+TEARS%3A+REDUX+%5BDario+Argento%27s+La+Terza+Madre+-+Obortis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7728dbd4fb3f09f6ed40b5eb981b5a8f4ef14869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,40,219,212,251,63,9,246,237,64,181,235,152,27,90,143,78,241,72,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
