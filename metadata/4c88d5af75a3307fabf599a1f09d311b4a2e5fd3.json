Yet mathematicians often describe their most important breakthroughs as creative, intuitive responses to ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox. A unique examination of this less-familiar aspect of mathematics, How Mathematicians Think reveals that mathematics is a profoundly creative activity and not just a body of formalized rules and results.\n\nNonlogical qualities, William Byers shows, play an essential role in mathematics. Ambiguities, contradictions, and paradoxes can arise when ideas developed in different contexts come into contact. Uncertainties and conflicts do not impede but rather spur the development of mathematics. Creativity often means bringing apparently incompatible perspectives together as complementary aspects of a new, more subtle theory. The secret of mathematics is not to be found only in its logical structure.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c88d5af75a3307fabf599a1f09d311b4a2e5fd3","amp;dn":"How+Mathematicians+Think%3A+Using+Ambiguity%2C+Contradiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c88d5af75a3307fabf599a1f09d311b4a2e5fd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,136,213,175,117,163,48,127,171,245,153,161,240,157,49,27,74,46,95,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
