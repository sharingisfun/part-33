Their solution is to design a vehicle exclusively for the elderly and then test it out in Dorset with a little help from a trio of pensioners.\n\nJames May assesses the new Range Rover around London and then shifts to Nevada for the ultimate challenge against an autonomous military machine. Plus actor James McAvoy is the star in the Reasonably Priced Car.\n\n\nNote: this is a PROPER release, no issues with sound or video.\n\n\nDon't forget to say thanks! ;)\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3375d53b9514176a78db1d9a58036fee0cd18927","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.S19E05.720p.REPACK.HDTV.x264-RiVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3375d53b9514176a78db1d9a58036fee0cd18927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,117,213,59,149,20,23,106,120,219,29,154,88,3,111,238,12,209,137,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
