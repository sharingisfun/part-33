How's The Music (Ovum Warmth Version)\n\nI have been a fan of the electronic genre for years, and this album has remained my absolute favorite since the day I purchased it. Even people who'd rather drive sticks through their ears than hear another electronica album will identify with at least one of the songs on this collection. After just purchasing my fifth copy of this album, (The others suffered a great deal of wear and tear due to numerous &quot;trips&quot;) every song still completely moves me, despite the record's age. With a variety pack of styles included... the thing that will absolutely amaze you is the consistency of Josh. It could be a smooth ambient or a deeeeeeep house track, yet it still sounds like Wink. { }flawless! If you're reading this and you have no more than a mere glimmer of interest in this album... it's worth it. It's more than worth it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb063db8457dc0cfb1e6ecdf7713a03bc51fd7b","amp;dn":"Josh+Wink+%28Winx%29+-+Left+Above+The+Clouds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb063db8457dc0cfb1e6ecdf7713a03bc51fd7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,176,99,219,132,87,220,12,251,30,110,205,247,113,58,3,188,81,253,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
