As per usual, I didn't see a collected torrent for this week's Marvel NOW! titles yet, so I thought I'd upload one. Included are:\n\nAvengers Assemble 024\nDeadpool 024\nFantastic Four 001 ANMN\nGuardians of the Galaxy 012 ANMN\nHawkeye 015\nIndestructible Hulk 019\nMighty Avengers 007\nSecret Avengers 016\nSuperior Spider-Man 028 ANMN\nThunderbolts 022 ANMN\nUncanny Avengers #17\nWolverine 002 ANMN\nWolverine and the X-Men 042\n\nAAAAAAAAAND...\n\nREVOLUTIONARY WAR: SUPERSOLDIERS #1\nPart 5 of &quot;Revolutionary War&quot;\n* Some of the most popular heroes of Marvel UK return for SUPERSOLDIERS Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and \n\nwhere the Supersoldiers go, trouble isn't far behind!\n* It's the Supersoldiers versus Mys-Tech in all-out war!\n* When a vast army of Mys-Tech Psycho Wraiths come calling on a small Scottish town, it's up to the Supersoldiers to put them down for good!\n\n\nIf you like them and have the money, BUY THEM and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. \n\nSeriously, buy the comics you have money for. But only the ones you think deserve your money-- vote with your dollars, and also make your voices heard. Marvel has a pretty good internet presence, which also means they read emails, tweets, tumblr responses, facebook comments. They've shown that they are solely focused on sales numbers-- vote with yr money, and tell them with words (not curses). They WILL listen, eventually. You know-- the internets.\n\nAll my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nPersonal commentary of the week:  *sniff* &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men 042&quot; brings us the final issue of the stories of the Jean Grey School! *sob* Also, speaking of X-Men-- GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! \nAnd speaking of Guardians of the Galaxy--\nGUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!11\n\n~*I'm hooked on a feeling*~\n\n*floats off into the sky*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be532a03d5a0586eeb8cced82e04a447d69a8a4c","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW+Week+67+All-New+Week+10+02%2F26%2F2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be532a03d5a0586eeb8cced82e04a447d69a8a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,83,42,3,213,160,88,110,235,140,206,216,46,4,164,71,214,154,138,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
