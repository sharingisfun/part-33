Only 24 percent of people have a favorable opinion of the Republicans. No wonder theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying methods to get their way other than by winning elections. Hey, when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re down to 24 percent, the only pathway open to you is hostage taking. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a vicious and dumb circleÃ¢â‚¬â€they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t win elections with their pathetic numbers, and the stuff they try instead just makes their numbers even worse.\n\nYesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short-term offer on raising the debt ceiling from House Republicans was too little, too late. And it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reopen the government! So it was too nothing as well. The Republicans showed up with an offer to just the raise the debt limit for a measly 6 weeks. Well, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the first time that some of these Republicans have heard the phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not nearly long enough.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRush Limbaugh has blasted John Boehner for Ã¢â‚¬Å“snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Those werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the jaws of victory, Rush. That was the Ã¢â‚¬Å“JawsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of public opinion about to pull a great white shark number on the GOP.\n\nThis shutdown came from two sourcesÃ¢â‚¬â€Ted Cruz pushed for it, and the Koch brothers paid for it. Now it seems the neither of them wants it. Ted Cruz has a much harder time distancing himself from the mess. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been seen pushing this shutdown idea more than Fred Thompson has been pushing reverse mortgages. The difference is that Fred Thompson pushing bogus finance schemes onto gullible elderly people has a lot more dignity than what Ted Cruz was doing pushing the shutdown idea.\n\nThe Republican establishment thinks that the Tea Party wing is suicidal. Well if what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t suicidal, then it must be auto-erotic asphyxiation. When you get down to it, this Ted Cruz shutdown is more auto-erotic asphyxiation than suicide. While he was launching his crusade, Ted always seemed more turned-on than suicidal. But then the Ã¢â‚¬Å“auto-eroticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ part implies that Ted is just doing it to himself. Where does Mike Lee fit into this little tableau? Is it still Ã¢â‚¬Å“auto-eroticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ if there are two guys doing it to each other?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acab6eb794232d33e9e192222569eb19b404bcb4","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+11+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acab6eb794232d33e9e192222569eb19b404bcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,171,110,183,148,35,45,51,233,225,146,34,37,105,235,25,180,4,188,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
