It was released in October 1976, after the group had broken up.\n\nMade in Europe features songs recorded in concert 4 April in Graz, Austria, 5 April in SaarbrÃƒÂ¼cken, Germany, and 7 April 1975 in Paris, France with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. According to the liner notes included on Mk III: The Final Concerts, though, the material featured on Made in Europe came, for the most part, from the SaarbrÃƒÂ¼cken show.[citation needed] The album is said to have experienced extensive studio editing and/or overdubbing of crowd noise and applause.[citation needed] Certainly there is a tape-loop of applause, given away by a whistling fan.[original research?]\n\nThe songs featured on the album are from Deep Purple's Burn and Stormbringer albums.\n\nIn 1990, the album was remastered and re-released in the US by Metal Blade Records with distribution by Warner Bros.\n\nThis record, which had been out of print in the US, was re-released by Friday Music label on 31 July 2007 (along with Stormbringer and Come Taste the Band). While the label's website claims that the album has been digitally remastered, it is unclear which tapes were used as a source for this release.\n\nFLAC\n\nDeep Purple\n\nMade In Europe\n\n1976\n\nCD - 1990 - EMI (Italy)\n\n&quot;Burn&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Jon Lord, Ian Paice) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:32\n&quot;Mistreated&quot; (interpolating &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 11:32\n&quot;Lady Double Dealer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:15\n&quot;You Fool No One&quot; (Blackmore, Coverdale, Hughes, Lord, Paice) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 16:42\n&quot;Stormbringer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:38","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ccd3e2834858370a4d8790429d20cf0e16848c2","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Made+In+Europe+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ccd3e2834858370a4d8790429d20cf0e16848c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,205,62,40,52,133,131,112,164,216,121,4,41,210,12,240,225,104,72,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
