I can tell you that she allways told me to be nicely stoned while listening to this record. She says it works very well with moroccan black. No wonder she likes it so much. So biggie up and respect to my mother and the allmighty Jah who created her, those Climax Blues Band people and the moroccan black. Enjoy!  Have also a look on other torrents I've posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko ! Thank you!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAupa Athletik!
