This LP gem is high in demand and fetches ridiculous prices at auctions. Two true masters of French jazz - Michel Colombier and Ivan Jullien - teamed up in 1970 with other well known musicians from the French scene to record this excellent album at the famous Barclay Studios in Paris. The music was composed and played by Colombier and Jullien together with an allstar ensemble of finest studio players. Famous drummer AndrÃƒÂ© Arpino can be heard aswell as hammond master Eddy Louiss, Maurice Vander on piano, Raymond Gimenez on electric guitar or Roger GuÃƒÂ©rin on trumpet. &quot;Riviera Sound No.1&quot; stands out as one of the perfect moments in French jazz funk, never reissued before and remaining on top of collector's lists since years. There are not many facts to be found about this vinyl artefact, although nearly everybody of the featured musicians earned himself an excellent worldwide reputation.\n\nThe ten piece horn section delivers a great funky big band style from start to finish, very groovy and always with this special mediterranean Riviera vibe. Wicked jazz funk is mixed with soundtrack or drama library sounds, like &quot;Opening&quot;, that was also released on an impossible to find 45 single in the same year. &quot;Crescendo&quot; tears up every dancefloor, while &quot;Talk&quot; provides a monster open drum break at the beginning. Softer titles like &quot;Edith&quot; or &quot;The Looser&quot; draw their inspiration from cool jazz, modern jazz or pop music of the time. &quot;I Remember Otis&quot; is a soul and funk infused tribute to Otis Redding in a delicate Majestics or Mohawks style and the perfect groover &quot;Wake The Monster&quot; was re-recorded by Ivan Jullien later on for the always in demand Italian mod beat band &quot;I Pyranas&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388d0ea98665cc8116766a3db910ef6c851a67ea","amp;dn":"Big+Jullien+%26amp%3B+His+All+Stars+-+Riviera+Sound+No.1+%281970%29+%5B320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388d0ea98665cc8116766a3db910ef6c851a67ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,141,14,169,134,101,204,129,22,118,106,61,185,16,239,108,133,26,103,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
