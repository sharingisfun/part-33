In order to access the new story content from Broken Steel, the player will have to have finished the main storyline from the base game. However, the level cap expansion will take effect upon installation of the DLC, so players previously stalled at level 20 will once again accumulate XP even if they haven't finished the main storyline.\n\nBroken Steel also adds a couple of new side quests, most of which have to do with escorting freshly processed clean water across the Wasteland and protecting it from Raiders. Broken Steel takes about five hours to complete and side missions could take up to an hour to finish.\n\nThe third DLC for Fallout 3 adds new enemies including Albino Radscorpions, Feral Ghoul Reavers, Super Mutant Overlords and Enclave Hellfire Troopers. These are equipped with new armor and weaponry which the player can acquire. Broken Steel also adds several new perks to cover the additional 10 levels as well as new encounters.\n\nYou must have Fallout 3 updated to the latest version to play, put the files to your Fallout 3 data directory. You will still get achievements if you're using the retail version with this expansion, even if you didn't buy the expansion.\n\n      Minimum System Requirements:\n          o Windows XP/Vista\n          o 1GB System RAM (XP) / 2GB System RAM (Vista)\n          o 2.4 Ghz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent processor\n          o Direct X 9.0c compliant videocard with 256MB RAM (NVIDIA 6800 or better / ATI X850 or better)\n      Recommended System Requirements:\n          o Intel Core 2 Duo processor\n          o 2 GB System RAM\n          o Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 512MB RAM (NVIDIA 8800 series, ATI 3800 series)\n          o Supported Video Card Chipsets:\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 200 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 9800 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 9600 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 8800 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 8600 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 8500 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 8400 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 7900 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 7800 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 7600 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 7300 series\n                + NVIDIA GeForce 6800 series\n                + ATI HD 4800 series\n                + ATI HD 4600 series\n                + ATI HD 3800 series\n                + ATI HD 3600 series\n                + ATI HD 3400 series\n                + ATI HD 2900 series\n                + ATI HD 2600 series\n                + ATI HD 2400 series\n                + ATI X1900 series\n                + ATI X1800 series\n                + ATI X1600 series\n                + ATI X1300 series\n                + ATI X850 series\n\nInstallation:\nPlace the bik files into your Fallout3 datavideo folder.\nPlace the bsa and esm files into your Fallout 3 data folder.\nActivate the files in the Fallout 3 Launcher.\nPlay the game!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64957000c5dacf143a38de49d004f540edb0e46d","amp;dn":"Fallout+3+-+Broken+Steel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64957000c5dacf143a38de49d004f540edb0e46d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,149,112,0,197,218,207,20,58,56,222,73,208,4,245,64,237,176,228,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
