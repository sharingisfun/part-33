Whether it be commands binded to a key, or change what buttons make you move.\n\nIf a server is using plugings that require spoutcraft (GUI plugins such as SpoutHelp, or item plugins like Guns+ or ManaBags) you must use spoutcraft to get the full potential.

Double click to run and allow it to download the necessary files before playing.\n\nThis was cracked on Linux and runs fine. I tried it over on my Windows partition and it had a little trouble (I think it was my connection) it kept returning errors. However, after it finally downloaded all the necessary files it ran fine. \n\nAny problems, please post them down in the comments.\n\n- XiiCandySackiiX\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc987a590713f8d64e62a34c36402a09ca148130","amp;dn":"Spoutcraft+Launcher+Crack+V8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc987a590713f8d64e62a34c36402a09ca148130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,152,122,89,7,19,248,214,78,98,163,76,54,64,42,9,202,20,129,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
