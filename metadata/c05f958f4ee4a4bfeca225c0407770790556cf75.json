And she has her best friend, Maddie, to keep her company. The girls have to pretend to be twin sisters, which Louisa thinks just adds to the adventure!\n\nCountry Manor School isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all excitement, though. Louisa isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how she feels about her new roommates: athletic but snobby Rosie and everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s-a-conspiracy Evelyn. Even Maddie seems different away from home, quiet and worried all the time. \n\nStill, Louisa loves CMS - the survival skills classes, the fresh air. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even miss not having a TV, or the internet, or any contact with home. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s for their own safety, after all. \n\nOr is it?\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/b8rNMZ2.jpg[/img]\n\nNow that best friends Louisa, Rosie, Evelyn, and Maddie know the truth - or at least the danger they're in - the girls have run away from their &quot;safe&quot; country retreat. But life is riskier than ever, and Rosie still doesn't know who she can trust. \n\nRosie's survival skills are top-notch. But how well can she keep her own secrets?\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/l46I76H.jpg[/img]\n\nEvelyn has always suspected that things are more sinister and more complicated than they seem. Now that Maddie has been kidnapped, Rosie, Louisa, and the boys are paying more attention to Evelyn's theories. As the group makes their way toward war-torn Chicago, they're under constant threat of capture. Danger and dark surprises lurk around every twist of the road.\n\nEvelyn knows they need a solid plot to find Maddie. But what the group comes up with may be their riskiest plan yet: infiltrating the Alliance itself. Even Evelyn has her doubts. Can they save Maddie before it's too late?\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/nFNOT3k.jpg[/img]\n\nMaddie is ready for action. Louisa, Evelyn, and Rosie helped rescue her from the Alliance's grasp, and she's learned an enormous, game-changing secret: her mother is the leader of the Resistance!\n\nBut reuniting with her long-absent mother is not going to be easy. As Maddie and her friends set out to find the Resistance headquarters, they are relentlessly pursued by the Alliance. Worst of all, members of their group have gone missing in the middle of rubble-strewn Chicago.\n\nMaddie and her friends have earned their battle scars, courage, and strength. But at this darkest hour, will they be able to make it back to their families... and freedom?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05f958f4ee4a4bfeca225c0407770790556cf75","amp;dn":"Tomorrow+Girls+Series+1-4+%28Eva+Gray%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c05f958f4ee4a4bfeca225c0407770790556cf75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,95,149,143,78,228,164,191,236,162,37,192,64,119,112,121,5,86,207,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
