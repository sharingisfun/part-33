Blues (1996)\n\nThis CD is a reissue of P.C. Blues, a trio album from 1957 that features pianist Red Garland with bassist Paul Chambers (the &quot;P.C.&quot; in the title) and drummer Art Taylor. In addition to the four original titles (which are highlighted by a sensitive version of &quot;Lost April&quot; and the lengthy &quot;Tweedle Dee Dee&quot;), Garland's feature on a 1956 Miles Davis record, &quot;Ahmad's Blues&quot; (which features him with Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones), adds to the value of this thoughtful but swinging release. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Ahmad's Blues\n02 - Lost April\n03 - Why Was I Born\n04 - Tweedle Dee Dee\n05 - The P. C. Blues\n\nPersonnel:\nRed Garland - piano\nPaul Chambers - bass\nPhilly Joe Jones (track 1) Art Taylor (tracks 2-5) - drums\n\nEnjoy and share!
