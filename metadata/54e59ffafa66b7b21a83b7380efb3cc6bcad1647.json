It is the lead track and first single from Henley&amp;#039;s 1984 album Building the Perfect Beast.\n\nThe music video to &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; is a French New Wave-influenced piece directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. Shot completely in black-and-white, it shows the &amp;#039;main character&amp;#039; of the song at three different stages of life (as a young boy, a young adult and middle-aged), in each case reminiscing about the past relationship. This is shown during the line &quot;A little voice inside my head said don&amp;#039;t look back, you can never look back&quot; at which point, each of the three people look back in turn. The young boy in the video (played by seven year old Josh Paul) resembles Henley to the extent that he also is a left-handed drummer. The cutaways of the &quot;boys&quot; jumping in the air appears to have been influenced by the 1938 film Olympia. Interspersed with these scenes are segments of Henley miming the words of the song while driving in a convertible. At its conclusion, the video uses the post-modern conceit of exposing its own workings, as with a wry expression Henley drives the car away from a rear projection screen.\n\nThe video won the Video of the Year at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards (leading Henley to comment at the Awards the following year that he had won for &quot;riding around in the back of a pickup&quot;). It also won that year&amp;#039;s awards for Best Direction, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography. The Best Direction award was presented to Mondino by Henley&amp;#039;s then-former Eagles bandmate, Glenn Frey.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54e59ffafa66b7b21a83b7380efb3cc6bcad1647","amp;dn":"Don+Henley+-+The+Boys+Of+Summer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54e59ffafa66b7b21a83b7380efb3cc6bcad1647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,229,159,250,250,102,183,178,26,131,183,56,14,251,60,198,188,173,22,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
