The Handbook is intended to provide a clearer understanding of the safety requirements of the Code.\nThe content of this Handbook is not meant to form a code of mandatory requirements. The mandatory language (&quot;shall&quot;) that is used in the CE Code, Part I, has not been used here. Care has been taken to ensure that the intent of the Code Rules is clear to the users of the Handbook. However, users of the Handbook must not under any circumstances rely on it to determine the current requirements of the Code. As always, reference must be made to the Code itself and any local amendments. CSA does not assume responsibility for any errors or omissions resulting from the information contained in this Handbook.\nPublication Year:\n2012\nTotal Pages:708\nPublisher:\nCSA\nMM Numbers:\nHardcopy EN 2021092\nPDF EN 2421416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b1aa84f3abba5c539584e4917050bce4ae2296","amp;dn":"2012+CE+Code+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b1aa84f3abba5c539584e4917050bce4ae2296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,177,170,132,243,171,186,92,83,149,132,228,145,112,80,188,228,174,34,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
