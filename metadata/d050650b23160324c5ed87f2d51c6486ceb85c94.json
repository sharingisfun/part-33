In this same spirit of tradition and innovation, Phan presents a landmark collection based on the premise that with an understanding of its central techniques and fundamental ingredients, Vietnamese home cooking can be as attainable and understandable as American, French, or Italian. \r\n\r\nWith solid instruction and encouraging guidance, perfectly crispy imperial rolls, tender steamed dumplings, delicately flavored whole fish, and meaty lemongrass beef stew are all deliciously close at hand. Abundant photography detailing techniques and equipment, and vibrant shots taken on location in Vietnam, make for equal parts elucidation and inspiration. And with master recipes for stocks and sauces, a photographic guide to ingredients, and tips on choosing a wok and seasoning a clay pot, this definitive reference will finally secure Vietnamese food in the home cookâ€™s repertoire.\r\n\r\nInfused with the authorâ€™s stories and experiences, from his early days as a refugee to his current culinary successâ€” Vietnamese Home Cooking is a personal and accessible guide to real Vietnamese cuisine from one of its leading voices","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d050650b23160324c5ed87f2d51c6486ceb85c94","amp;dn":"Vietnamese+Home+Cooking+%282012%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d050650b23160324c5ed87f2d51c6486ceb85c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,80,101,11,35,22,3,36,197,237,135,242,213,28,100,134,206,184,92,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
