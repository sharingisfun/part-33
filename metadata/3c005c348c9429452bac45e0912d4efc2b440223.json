Rockwell's\r\nprescription is radical, calling for the wholesale realignment of society away from the state and toward voluntary order. As the book\r\nincontrovertibly shows, the overwhelming problems that confront us\r\ntoday are no accident. They stem from the nature of government itself.\r\nOnly peaceful cooperation grounded in individuals, families, civil\r\nsociety, and markets can rescue us from our present plight.\r\n\r\nAgainst the State applies Murray Rothbardâ€™s unique\r\ncombination of individualist anarchism and Austrian economics to\r\ncontemporary America. Fueled by an out-of-control banking system, the\r\nAmerican Ãœber-State has become in essence fascist. We cannot escape our\r\npredicament through limited government or traditional political means:\r\ngovernment is incapable of controlling itself. Only a purely private\r\nsocial order can save us, and Rockwell succinctly sets out how an\r\nanarcho-capitalist society would work. \r\n\r\nIn 190 short pages, Rockwell has created nothing less than the modern\r\nmanifesto for today's anarcho-capitalist movement. This is the\r\nmust-read book of 2014 for libertarians interested in real arguments for\r\ncreating a peaceful, voluntary, free-market society.\r\n\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n \r\nPreface\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Why I Am an Anarcho-Capitalist\r\n\r\n1.
