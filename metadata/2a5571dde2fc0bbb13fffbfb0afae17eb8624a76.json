As such, and\naccording to the laws where the individuals of Linezer0 reside,\nit is not our responsibility what others desides to do with\nthese releases. However, let it be said quite clearly\n\n&quot;We DO NOT in any way condone the selling or redistribution\nof our cracks, this was NEVER our intention.&quot;\n\nLinezer0 does NOT take any responsibility of computer-loss\nor any data-errors that may occur from using our cracks.\nKeep in mind that you are using a third party sollution to\nsomething we did not develop in the first place.\n\nDo note that the usage of our cracks are legal in most\ncountries outside the United States, IF and ONLY IF you own a\nfull copy of the program/game - then you may use our cracks\nfor backup purposes, and only that.

Beware, they will\npunish you harder than if you stole the shrinkwrapped software\nin a mall. Though Linezer0's base of operation does not reside\nin the Unites States, and thus we are NOT bound to the\nUS legislations like:\n\nNo Electronic Theft Act\nDigital Millenium Copyright Act\nThe Patriot Act\nother US legislations\n\nYou should ALWAYS buy the software that you do use, or find\nsuitable Open Source replacements (as there are loads), we do\n\nBy using our cracks you automatically agree\nto the written agreement above, and thus the responsibility\nregarding whetever you are affected by any EULAs is\nwith YOU and YOU only.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a5571dde2fc0bbb13fffbfb0afae17eb8624a76","amp;dn":"EA.Monopoly.v1.1.13.iPhone.iPod.Touch-Lz0PDA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a5571dde2fc0bbb13fffbfb0afae17eb8624a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,85,113,221,226,252,11,187,19,255,251,251,10,250,225,126,184,98,74,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
