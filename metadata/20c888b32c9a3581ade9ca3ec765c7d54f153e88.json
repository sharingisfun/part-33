We&amp;#039;re so incredibly happy to be able to offer you this film on DVD, after it&amp;#039;s only been available on VHS for years! This film represents the pinnacle of old school martial arts, Gordon Liu and the Shaw Studios at their best. No martial arts fan should sleep another night without witnessing this masterpiece!\n\nAvg. Rating: \t\n  4.5 / 5 (based on 32 ratings). What did you think of it?\n\nPlot:\tAfter most of his family is slaughtered, Gordon Liu escapes to a monastery to train. When his eldest surviving sister is captured by the same villains who destroyed his family, Gordon leaves the monastery to fulfil his bloodlust and thirst for vengeance!\nOverview:\tThe Master Killer and The Venoms fight side by side in this all-time old school classic! A heroic family is double-crossed and massacred on the battlefield, and only two of the seven brothers--Gordon Liu (Master Killer) and Alexander Fu Sheng (Chinatown Kid)--survive the slaughter. Alexander Fu Sheng returns home to his mother and sisters, but has been driven insane by witnessing the slaughter of his father and five of his brothers. Gordon Liu escapes to a monastery, where his bloodlust and thirst for vengeance puts him at odds with the monks. His family believes him to be dead. When the eldest surviving daughter is captured by the same villains who destroyed his family, Gordon Liu leaves the monastery to rescue her. The final battle is spectacular, as only the director of &quot;the Master Killer&quot; can deliver. A must-see!\n\nCast: \tGordon Liu (Chia Hui)  ||  Alexander Fu Sheng  ||  Liu Chia Liang  ||  Wang Yu  ||  Mai Te Lo  ||  Liu Chia Yang  ||  Hsiao Ho  ||  Chu Tieh Hu  ||  Kara Hui Ying-Hung  ||  Lily Li Li-Li  ||  Johnny Wang (Lung Wei)  ||  Jue Tit Woh  ||  Phillip Ko Fei  ||  Yeung Jing Jing  ||  Yuen Tak  ||  Yang Tsing Tsing \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c888b32c9a3581ade9ca3ec765c7d54f153e88","amp;dn":"%5BKung+Fu%5D+8+Diagram+Pole+Fighter+%281983%29+-+DVD%2FRmvb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c888b32c9a3581ade9ca3ec765c7d54f153e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,200,136,179,44,154,53,129,173,233,202,62,199,101,199,213,79,21,62,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
