Emperor Nero has set his heart on a new wife but to clear a path for her, he must first assassinate his Empress, Claudia Octavia. Vespasian needs to tread carefully here - Nero's new lover, Poppaea Sabina, is no friend of his and her ascent to power spells danger. Meanwhile, Nero's extravagance has reached new heights, triggering a growing financial crisis in Britannia. Vespasian is sent to Londinium to rescue the situation, only to become embroiled in a deadly rebellion, one that threatens to destroy Britannia and de-stabilise the empire","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310856a0075b08929c5454c7f94cd875dedfcf11","amp;dn":"The+Furies+of+Rome+%28Vespasian+Series+Book+7%29+by+Robert+Fabbri+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310856a0075b08929c5454c7f94cd875dedfcf11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,8,86,160,7,91,8,146,156,84,84,199,249,76,216,117,222,223,207,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
