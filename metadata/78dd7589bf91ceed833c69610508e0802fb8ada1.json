His ideas have influenced and transformed thousands. In his new book, Muscle Revolution, Chad codifies the Waterbury system, making it easier than ever to understand this system and apply it. But the best part of the whole book - tons of free programs - in fact, close to a year's worth! I'm glad Muscle Revolution is part of my training library!&quot; Dr. John Berardi....\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Muscle Revolution? Introducing Chad Waterbury's long-awaited book! Most of my programs focus on delivering what most of my readers want; the biggest possible muscles, obtained as fast and efficiently as possible without the need for anabolic drugs. \n\nMuscle Revolution: ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more to building bigger muscles than walking into a gym and lifting heavy weights. In Muscle Revolution Chad Waterbury explores the hidden keys to a better physique. The first is performanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½training your body to improve strength and function as a direct path to improving appearance. The second is recoveryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½managing the amount of fatigue you induce and then making sure your body had enough time between workouts to get the benefits you want from each session. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just a tiny fraction of what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find in Muscle Revolution. \n\nMuscle Revolution - Improving strength and overall conditioning are important aspects of my programs, but to many readers, they're side effects. The real purpose is bigger muscles. \n\nThe Total Strength Program (TSP) is different. Sure, you'll get bigger muscles in any version of this 12-week program (and there are several versions to choose from, as I'll explain). But this time, the goal is to make yourself stronger. Much, much stronger. And not just stronger in general - although that, like hypertrophy will happen. I want you to get stronger in one or more of the three powerlifts: bench press, deadlift, and squat. But don't mistake this as a powerlifting program, and nothing more. It's a terrific program for powerlifters, but my goal is to help you use the powerlifts to reach your own goals, whether you compete in anything or work out for the classic reasons - strength, size, power, performance. \n\nThe key to TSP is one of the most effective strength-building methods I've used in more than a decade of working with athletes; the supramaximal hold. Don't let the jargon put you off. This is more straight forward than it sounds!\n\nHere's what you get in Muscle Revolution:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The Total Strength Program ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Chad Waterbury's most advanced and ingenious 12-week program for building more strength and muscle mass than you ever thought possible.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ How to train for every goal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ More muscle, more strength, better sports performance, less body fat.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ How to use food and supplements to gain, lose, or maintain weight, while improving body composition.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Waterbury's most popular programs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ From Anti-Bodybuilding Hypertrophy to Quattro Dynamo, and a guide to using each of them in a year-long program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78dd7589bf91ceed833c69610508e0802fb8ada1","amp;dn":"%5BCHAD+WATERBURY%5D+MUSCLE+REVOLUTION+-+MANTESHWER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78dd7589bf91ceed833c69610508e0802fb8ada1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,221,117,137,191,145,206,237,131,60,105,97,5,8,224,128,47,184,173,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
