Ninja freestyler. It's seventh grade. Anything is possible.\r\n\r\nAll Dillon wants is to be a real dancer. And if he wins a summer scholarship at Dance-Splosion, heâ€™s on his way. The problem? His dad wants him to play football. And Dillonâ€™s freestyle crew, the Dizzee Freekz, says that dance studios are for sellouts. His friends want Dillon to kill it at the auditionâ€”so he can turn around and tell the studio just how wrong their rules and creativity-strangling ways are.\r\n\r\nAt first, Dillonâ€™s willing to go along with his crewâ€™s plan, even convincing one of the snobbiest girls at school to work with him on his technique. But as Dillonâ€™s dancing improves, he wonders: what if studios arenâ€™t the enemy? And what if he actually has a shot at winning the scholarship?\r\n\r\nDillonâ€™s life is about to get crazy . . . on and off the dance floor in this kid-friendly humorous debut by Brooks Benjamin.\r\n\r\nâ€œA rollicking, big-hearted breakdance of a book. Itâ€™s a story about friendship thatâ€™s got all the moves: humor both sly and slapstick, a diverse cast of characters, and a winning narrator whoâ€™s trying to learn how to follow his heart, find the beat, and dance his pants right off.â€ â€”Kate Hattemer, author of *The Vigilante Poets of Selwyn Academy\r\n\r\nâ€œEqual parts jazz hands and karate chop, with a dash of football and a pirouette of pure heart. Dillon and the Dizzee Freekz are en pointe. This book will rock you! â€œâ€”Kristin Oâ€™Donnell Tubb, author of The 13th Sign*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d4141713b2bbd450211ffc5fb53d6b39d6a43f","amp;dn":"My+Seventh-Grade+Life+in+Tights+-+Brooks+Benjamin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71d4141713b2bbd450211ffc5fb53d6b39d6a43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,212,20,23,19,178,187,212,80,33,31,252,95,181,61,107,57,214,164,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
