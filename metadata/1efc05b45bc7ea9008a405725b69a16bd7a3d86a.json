It has many applications in our every day life such as air-conditioners, electric cars, sub-way trains, motor drives, renewable energy sources and power supplies for computers. This book covers all aspects of switching devices, converter circuit topologies, control techniques, analytical methods and some examples of their applications.\n\nDesigned to appeal to a new generation of engineering professionals, Power Electronics Handbook, 3rd Edition features four new chapters covering renewable energy, energy transmission, energy storage, as well as an introduction to Distributed and Cogeneration (DCG) technology, including gas turbines, gensets, microturbines, wind turbines, variable speed generators, photovoltaics and fuel cells, has been gaining momentum for quite some time now.smart grid technology. With this book readers should be able to provide technical design leadership on assigned power electronics design projects and lead the design from the concept to production involving significant scope and complexity.\n\n    * Contains 45 chapters covering all aspects of power electronics and its applications\n\n    * Three new chapters now including coverage Energy Sources, Energy Storage and Electric Power Transmission\n\n    * Contributions from more than fifty leading experts spanning twelve different countries\n\n\n# PDF 1362 pages\n# Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann; 3 edition (December 23, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123820367\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123820365\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1efc05b45bc7ea9008a405725b69a16bd7a3d86a","amp;dn":"Power+Electronics+Handbook+%2C3rd+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1efc05b45bc7ea9008a405725b69a16bd7a3d86a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,252,5,180,91,199,234,144,8,164,5,114,91,105,161,107,215,163,216,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
