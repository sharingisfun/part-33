Magic is fun, but it's also hard, and there always seem to be consequences. \n\nRuth Chew's children loved stories about witches, and she figured that other children would love them too . . . and they do. Here are three of her best, each full of fanciful fun and magical mayhem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29759c65b6a0d628262b70b570bd5d9481920079","amp;dn":"Three+Witch+Tales+-+Ruth+Chew.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29759c65b6a0d628262b70b570bd5d9481920079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,117,156,101,182,160,214,40,38,43,112,181,112,189,93,148,129,146,0,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
