Technology is treated as irrelevant to\n               the quest - literally serving as mere vehicles for the\n               human crew, and as a shell for the immature HAL entity.\n               Story told as a montage of impressions, music and\n               impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail. A\n               very influential film and still a class act, even after\n               25 years.\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                                                               \n                                                       \n                               \n                                                   \n                           . ..:CONTACT:.. .     \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                                                     \n                                            \n                          No Thanks                   \n                                                        \n                     We Are A Closed Group               \n                                                         \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                            \n                       . ..:iNFO:.. .                \n                                                                  \n                                                                      \n                         Enjoy This Fine DVDRip                      \n                                                                       \n                                                 \n                                                   \n                               \n                                                       \n                             . ..:GREETiNGS:.. .               \n                                                                      \n     \n                               BaCo , BarCode , aGGr0                 \n                  and very special greetings to TBVCD and Wondernet   \n                                 And All Others We Forgot\n                                                                      \n                                                               \n                                                       \n                   ASCii       \n                                by                 \n                                 SpAwN!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:264b68ba66a60633193a8d256849c099083079c7","amp;dn":"2001.A.Space.Odyssey.1968.DVDRip.XViD.AC3.iNTERNAL-FFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"264b68ba66a60633193a8d256849c099083079c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,75,104,186,102,166,6,51,25,58,141,37,104,73,192,153,8,48,121,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
