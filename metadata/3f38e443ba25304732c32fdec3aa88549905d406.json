Claims that it is a pseudo-science or a weapon of ideological warfare have been commonplace and there is not even a consensus as to whether intelligence exists and, if it does, whether it can be measured. As a result the debate about it has centered on the nurture versus nature controversy and especially on alleged racial differences and the heritability of intelligence - all of which have major policy implications. This book aims to penetrate the mists of controversy, ideology and prejudice by providing a clear non-mathematical framework for the definition and measurement of intelligence derived from modern factor analysis. Building on this framework and drawing on everyday ideas the author address key controversies in a clear and accessible style and explores some of the claims made by well known writers in the field such as Stephen Jay Gould and Michael Howe.\n\n186 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (September 20, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0521544785\nISBN-13: 978-0521544788","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f38e443ba25304732c32fdec3aa88549905d406","amp;dn":"Measuring+Intelligence+%282004%29+by+David+John+Bartholomew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f38e443ba25304732c32fdec3aa88549905d406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,56,228,67,186,37,48,71,50,195,47,222,195,170,136,84,153,5,212,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
