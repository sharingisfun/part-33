Cities on the Edge.\nAndrew Marr takes a look at safety and security, two of the biggest challenges faced by each and every metropolis. Whether earthquake, terrorism, flood or just crime, it is the geology, politics and social makeup of the megacities that make them some of the most profitable and dangerous places to live. Andrew starts in Mexico City, the kidnap capital of the world. The compactness of the megacity often means that the super rich must live closely beside the super poor. Andrew finds out how evasive driving and bulletproof vests are protecting Mexico's super rich and middle classes. In London, he joins a Metropolitan Police riot unit on a practice routine, and hangs out with boy racers in Tokyo. And he meets the canine helpers responsible for saving lives in the event of terrorist attack.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011ql6k&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011ql6k&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid and SRT available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49820bf875b7001af2b131ef3230624c298c1204","amp;dn":"BBC+Megacities+2of3+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49820bf875b7001af2b131ef3230624c298c1204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,130,11,248,117,183,0,26,242,177,49,239,50,48,98,76,41,140,18,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
