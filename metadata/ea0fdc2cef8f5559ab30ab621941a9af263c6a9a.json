The mellow collection of great standards includes 64 minutes of such top artists as Gary Burton, Jim Hall, and Stan Getz. Dennis Rowland, Karrin Allyson, and Tom Lellis contribute vocal ballads. This installment of the Jazz Moods series is beautiful listening.  ~ David Horiuchi\n\nI stumbled across this album in a record store a couple of years ago. When I played it for the first time, I had to stop what I was doing and found my self sitting still to listen, enchanted not only with the beautiful quality of music, but also the terrific selection of tunes. I searched for the other Concord CDs listed on the jacket and am delighted to have found so many available through Amazon. I love them all, but Jazz by the Fire is still one that I play regularly. ~ Nancy Sommer\n\nJazz Moods - Jazz by the Fire Tracks:\n01 Gary Burton &amp; Friends  - For All We Know \n02 Scott Hamiltion with Strings  - My Foolish Heart \n03 Dennis Rowland  - Easy Living \n04 Stefan Scaggiari Trio  - Bewitched, Bothered, And Bewildered \n05 Jim Hall  - Prelude To A Kiss \n06 Karrin Allyson  - I Didn't Know About You \n07 Ray Brown Trio featuring Gene Harris  - That's All \n08 Stan Getz  - How Long Has This Been Going On\n09 Tom Lellis  - My One And Only Love \n10 Alan Broadbent  - Lady In The Lake \n11 Stanley Cowell  - A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea0fdc2cef8f5559ab30ab621941a9af263c6a9a","amp;dn":"Jazz+Moods+-+Jazz+by+the+Fire+%282000%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea0fdc2cef8f5559ab30ab621941a9af263c6a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,15,220,44,239,143,85,89,171,48,171,98,25,65,169,175,38,60,106,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
