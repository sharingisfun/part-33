Brown's informative booklet Last Court of Appeal which tells the story of how Americans have sold out their god-given right to true freedom and replaced it with a false &quot;democracy&quot; instead of a true republic of self-governing free men as their founding fathers intended. Is the democratic right to vote really equal to maintaining true freedom? What role does the militia play? What about posse comitatus &amp; the 2nd amendment? Also includes discussions about sovereignty vs. serf, subjects vs. citizens and magna carta. 10 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0367113f4bcb1c9bf79b03b7f4b9bfe4eba855","amp;dn":"Brown-Last+Court+of+Appeal%28republic+vs+democracy%2Csovereignity+vs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0367113f4bcb1c9bf79b03b7f4b9bfe4eba855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,3,103,17,63,75,203,28,155,247,155,3,183,244,185,191,228,235,168,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
