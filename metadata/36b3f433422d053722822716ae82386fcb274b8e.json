She sings oh so sweet and hot damn strong. In the past I have much preferred drums behind her. Tonight in this more-or-less acoustic setting, her Body Electric is out there almost all alone with her people. And I'm all so blown away. \n\nHere it is six months after the alleged titanic acoustic disaster of a national debut on 'Saturday Night Live,' and Lana is your top of the wild world girl tonight. \n\nMy National Anthem Riseth (if you please) : \n\nLana Del Rey Orbisong Bird Of Paradise, Born To Ride High Away \n\n(You are good to go with her ultra blue video.) \n_______________________________________________\n\n\nForward into the Blast Fire Away!\n__________________________________\n\n\nLana Del Rey is expected to bring a little bit of the new 'Ultraviolence' when she headlines this summer's rock fest circuit.\n\nSummertime and the living is ez ride her under ultraviolent rey of light. \n\nOK, bitches. I will wait a million years, or till April she will come down to see her people. \n\nLana's major label debut album &quot;Born To Die&quot; has just sold its 1 millionth copy in the US. \n\nFinally America is ready at long last for one of its own. \n\nLana is now about to start her first tour of the land where two years ago she was spurned in one SNL-debut hell of an entrance through the exit door. \n\nSunburst through things first as Lana will take a triumphant ride in coach to Coachella. Only to bella-burn it right fucking down to a cindarella, Brothers Grimm-type happy ending. \n\nLana's lava love will spread across this land, even all over Colorado's hallowed Red Rocks. &quot;...Paint it black, paint it black, you devil doll!&quot; \n\nThen our angel from hell will set her sights once again on that precious stone set in the silver sea where she was first welcomed with diamonds...\n\n\n* * * * * TJI : Lana Del Rey self-confirms Glastonbury appearance : Singer will perform at Worthy Farm on June 28 * * * * * \n\nnme.com/news/lana-del-rey, March 28, 2014 -- Lana Del Rey will perform at Glastonbury in June. \n\nThe singer has the Worthy Farm festival in her list of forthcoming live shows on the Primary Talent website. Primary Talent is Del Rey's booking agency and responsible for all of her concert appearances. According to Del Rey's page on the website she will play on June 28. \n\nThe page also lists appearances at other European festivals including Rock En Seine in Paris, France as well as Ireland's Cork Live at Marquee and Norway's Bergen festival. \n\n...Earlier this week Lana Del Rey announced details of a forthcoming US tour in April, fuelling speculation about the release date of her forthcoming second album, 'Ultraviolence'. Del Rey previously mentioned an album release date of May 1 in conversation with fans, which would place it towards the middle of the tour. There has thus far been no official announcement of the release date or tracklisting. \n\n[Per news.radio.com, of her new album...] &quot;It is absolutely gorgeous - darker then the first - so dark it's almost unlistenable and wrong,&quot; the &quot;Video Games&quot; chanteuse explained regarding the allegedly finished Ultraviolence during a recent Twitter Q&amp;A. \n\n&quot;But I love it.&quot; \n________________\n___________________\n\n\nHit or miss me miss just kiss me hard before you Lana a-go-go all ultraviolent on my ass.\n______________\n\nCap samples... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/3LDR-NationalAnthemLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0115_20140207_224559-1.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/3LDR-NationalAnthemLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0115_20140207_224559-1.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/3LDR-NationalAnthemLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0143_20140207_224959.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/3LDR-NationalAnthemLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0143_20140207_224959.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/2LDR-VideoGamesLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0129_20140207_231018.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/2LDR-VideoGamesLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0129_20140207_231018.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/3LDR-NationalAnthemLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0417_20140207_225508.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/3LDR-NationalAnthemLiveSBSRmpg_snapshot_0417_20140207_225508.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-71660.png~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/vlcsnap-71660.png~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/de4fcbf6-6d9f-4cfd-9a8d-a495b235b455.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Lana/de4fcbf6-6d9f-4cfd-9a8d-a495b235b455.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b3f433422d053722822716ae82386fcb274b8e","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+2012-07-06%2C+Super+Bock+Super+Rock+-+TV+Highs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b3f433422d053722822716ae82386fcb274b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,179,244,51,66,45,5,55,34,130,39,22,174,130,56,111,203,39,75,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
