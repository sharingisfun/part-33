It was released in CD and LP formats, by, respectively, the Robotic Empire and HyperRealist record labels.\n\nTo quote the album booklet: &quot;In a nutshell the concept behind the songs was to document the different points on a path to self-realization. In our interpretation of this journey, the wanderer ends up essentially in the same place that he or she began, if not humbled and even more overwhelmed. In a sense the ending is somewhat tragic, but without experiencing all of the lows how can anyone ever appreciate the amazing subtleties that this world has to offer? And so, if the search for beauty and understanding is cyclical and unending, then at least we&amp;#039;ll never stop experiencing the thrill of the hunt...&quot;\n\nThe packaging of the album is notably original. It is a four-fold flap with artwork along each side. The lyric booklet is glued to an inner flap, along with the CD tray. The artwork (along with the lyrics actually handwritten in the booklet) was done by band member, Drew.\n\nThe name of the album is taken from the track &quot;Interview at the Ruins&quot;. The last words of this song are &quot;a murmur from the ruins echoes softly as the roots undo, and the branch becomes&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1. &quot;Intro&quot; ? 0:55\n2. &quot;Same Shade as Concrete&quot; ? 4:28\n3. &quot;Crowquill&quot; ? 2:44\n4. &quot;In the Nervous Light of Sunday&quot; ? 6:17\n5. &quot;Interview at the Ruins&quot; ? 5:09\n6. &quot;Non-Objective Portrait of Karma&quot; ? 6:46\n7. &quot;Kill the Switch&quot; ? 9:33\n8. &quot;A Crater to Cough In&quot; ? 8:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9327922b2c63b6a05b258ab47a983d1a3b0ea703","amp;dn":"Circle+Takes+the+Square+-+As+the+Roots+Undo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9327922b2c63b6a05b258ab47a983d1a3b0ea703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,39,146,43,44,99,182,160,91,37,138,180,122,152,61,26,59,14,167,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
