ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EchoesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has been produced by Richard X (MIA, Kelis, Goldfrapp) who Will chose after falling in love with Steve MasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (Beta Band) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Boys OutsideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ album that Richard produced. With ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EchoesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Will has sidestepped some of his traditional sounds to move more into the world of electronic music, making an album of sophistry and gentility that pulses with the undercurrents of the dance-floor. The sweeping strings and key changes of his hit ballads have made way for synthesised melody, towards something sparer and more controlled. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I had to learn to undo my musical muscle memory,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ he explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“To allow space into the music.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\nWill has written all but one song on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EchoesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ along with a personally assembled roll call of collaborators including Jim Eliot &amp; Mima Stilwell (Kylie), Andy Cato (Groove Armada) and Pascal Gabriel (Ladyhawke). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JealousyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is WillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first single release since the acclaimed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“HistoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ collaboration with Groove Armada that became one of the sounds of last summer.\n\n[img]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/img]\n\n    *   1.
