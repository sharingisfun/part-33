Set to coincide with the release of the Acclaim video game (Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M), Armorines Volume II tells the story of Sergeant Anthony Lewis, Myra Lane, Michelle Sirot, and Tork, an unlikely team of soldiers chosen to wear technology derived from the X-O Manowar armor and save the world from the invasion of alien bugs. From the snow swept wastelands of Siberia to the dark jungles of Brazil, this series launches a new era in armored warfare full of fast-paced action, high-tech weaponry, and a hideous form of evil set on world domination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:136394aea4424aeff285e4239c4e57d789f1db0c","amp;dn":"Armorines+v2+%5BAcclaim%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"136394aea4424aeff285e4239c4e57d789f1db0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,99,148,174,164,66,74,239,242,133,228,35,156,78,87,215,137,241,219,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
