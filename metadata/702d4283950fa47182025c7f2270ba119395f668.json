This is called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerception.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Most of this happens on an\nUNCONSCIOUS level.\nWe then take what we get from our senses and we process this\ninformation. We compare it to what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve experienced before, we classify it,\nwe imagine it in different ways, and we have UNCONSCIOUS reactions to it.\nNext, we make decisions about what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to do with what we\njust experienced. Again, these are mostly UNCONSCIOUS.\nFinally, we take action on what we decided to do. You guessed it...\nagain, mostly unconsciously.\nThis description is oversimplified, but I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a useful model to\nwork with here.\nBasically, I believe that men and women go through these four stages\na little differently. And when it comes to sex, I believe that they go through\nthem much differently.\nI mention this because most people deal with other people the way\nthat they want to be dealt with. They communicate in ways that make sense\nto themselves. They usually assume that they know whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best for others\nwithout checking first.\nThis only makes sense. Most people donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t walk around saying to\nthemselves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHmmm, I wonder if Sarah tastes the same thing as I do when\nshe drinks coffee?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI wonder if water tastes exactly the same to her...\nor if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just slightly different...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nMost people have asked these questions once or twice in life, but they\nusually stop asking once they decide that most people have the same\nexperiences as they do when they drink coffee, etc......\n\n\ndownload to read\n\nseed! seed! seed!\t\n\nkick ass torrent http://www.kat.ph/user/j-william/\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702d4283950fa47182025c7f2270ba119395f668","amp;dn":"How.To.Turn.A.Woman.On.Satisfy.Her.In.A.Big.Way.%5BJ-William%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702d4283950fa47182025c7f2270ba119395f668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,45,66,131,149,15,164,113,130,2,92,127,34,112,186,17,147,149,246,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
