While pursuing much of the same formula as on No Jacket Required, there was also a move toward more organic production as Collins abandoned some of the drum machines and prominent keyboards in the up-tempo numbers in favor of live instrumentation. The decision was a good one as there&amp;#039;s no doubt that tracks such as &quot;Find a Way to My Heart&quot; and &quot;Hang in Long Enough&quot; have enough bite to outlast his more dated sounding mid-80s material. As usual, there are a bit too many generic ballads here, but when Collins moves out of his formula as on the dramatic gospel-influenced &quot;I Wish it Would Rain Down,&quot; featuring Eric Clapton, the results are staggering.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Hang in Long Enough  [4:44]\n02 - That&amp;#039;s Just the Way It Is  [5:20]\n03 - Do You Remember?
