Now, in Cooking for Family and Friends, Trisha opens her life and her kitchen once more with a trove of recipes from a lifetime of potlucks and colorful gatherings. \r\n \r\nTrisha has that southern hospitality gene and sheâ€™s a big believer that cooking for someone else is an act of love. From breakfasts in bed to hearty casseroles and festive holiday meals, Trishaâ€™s delicious recipes are dedicated to her loved ones, including her husband Garth Brooks (whoâ€™s her number one cooking fan and the contributor of a few knockout recipes of his own). \r\n \r\nTrisha knows how good it feels to bring something to the table. It brings everyone closer together if theyâ€™ve had a hand in preparing a meal. These recipes all come with memories attachedâ€”of potlucks with good friends, church suppers, family fish fries, and beach picnics, Motherâ€™s Day, and Christmas gatherings. Many are handed down from her mother, her aunts and cousins, or longtime friends, while others are her own contemporary improvisations on classic southern fare. Each oneâ€”whether a main dish, a tasty side, or a decadent dessertâ€”comes with a heartwarming story from Trishaâ€™s life that may remind you of some of your own favorite family foods, or inspire you to create new traditions. \r\n \r\nYou donâ€™t have to be a southerner to enjoy Yearwood family specialties such as:\r\n \r\nâ€¢ Hot Corn Dip\r\nâ€¢ Cornbread Salad with French Dressing\r\nâ€¢ Baked Bean Casserole\r\nâ€¢ Jambalaya\r\nâ€¢ Pumpkin Roll\r\nâ€¢ Old Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake\r\n\r\nPlus, Trisha (and her sister and mother) offer up loads of practical advice, on everything from easily icing a cake to cutting a slice of pie, time-saving tips; and ingredient substitutions. With full-color photographs taken at Trishaâ€™s home, this soulful and sincere testament to a southern life well-lived will delight both country music fans and home cooks everywhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bdf5b7e115758b09f69052af67a5c664edaf2cb","amp;dn":"Home+Cooking+with+Trisha+Yearwood+%282010%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bdf5b7e115758b09f69052af67a5c664edaf2cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,223,91,126,17,87,88,176,159,105,5,42,246,122,92,102,78,218,242,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
