Unless you know how to alter the boot files and revert back to desktop instead.. its not that hard of a job, about 5 mins infact. This will allow you to close T4 down without it shuting down your whole system\n\nMake sure you install all drivers/ software you so wish to use with T4 before you put T4 on else T4 will not work corectly afterwards.\n\n\n**** THIS IS A CLEAN IMAGE ****\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e456c06f2902a3acf64dd3a91544adf1d27835f","amp;dn":"T4+RDS+5.06.06.iso+%5BKeyholder%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e456c06f2902a3acf64dd3a91544adf1d27835f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,69,108,6,242,144,42,58,207,100,221,58,145,84,74,223,29,39,131,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
