Lovik (Author), J. Douglas Guy (Author), Monika Chavez (Author)\n\nVORSPRUNG is an innovative and lively first-year program that uses a five-skills approach, emphasizing the acquisition of communicative as well as cultural competence without sacrificing attention to formal accuracy. Utilizing &quot;focus on form&quot; activities in an engaging, personalized fashion, VORSPRUNG helps students develop realistic abilities in speaking, listening, and reading German. The program presents a systematic, clear introduction to the essentials of German grammar and practices high-frequency structures and vocabulary in interactive activities. In addition, it provides students with the cultural knowledge that is relevant to their own lives and then asks them to compare their cultures to the habits and behaviors of the German-speaking people of Europe. In order to prepare students for successful communication in today's rapidly changing world, VORSPRUNG exposes them to a wealth of spoken and written authentic textual materials. To support this focus on spoken and written German, VORSPRUNG offers an array of in-class activities that fosters accuracy and provides ample opportunities for students to practice German in authentic contexts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f138c9bf30bf7e2121ed45b5df9471c818cc6a","amp;dn":"Vorsprung+2nd+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f138c9bf30bf7e2121ed45b5df9471c818cc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,241,56,201,191,48,191,126,33,33,237,69,181,223,148,113,200,24,204,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
