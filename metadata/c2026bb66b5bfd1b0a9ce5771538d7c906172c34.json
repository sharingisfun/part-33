To be sure, his 1958 hit version \nis probably the most definitive, but this version by Los Lobos (arguably \nheirs to Valens' throne) is equallyeffective.\n \nCategorically 10ccs last undisputed classic, and, deservedly, their third \nBritish chart-topper (it reached number 44 in the U.S.). Taken from 1978's \nBloody Tourists album, a delightfully sunny mock reggae backing accompanies \nthe cautionary tale of a white man lost in the Jamaican backwaters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a true \nstory, it is said, which they heard firsthand from the Moody Blues'\nJustin Hayward. \n\nIn more politically correct times, one could get quite offended by the \npseudo-patois voices which utter dire imprecations, or the trouble-soothing \nchorus of &quot;I don't like cricket...I love it!,&quot; as though even the toughest \nghetto gangster can be distracted by the clunk of ball on willow. Fortunately, \nlisteners in 1978 had more important things to worry about than imagined \ninsults or latent British colonialism ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for them, &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot; stood as\none of the most single-mindedly joyous stabs at white reggae ever conceived. \nAnd one of the most successful as well. We should enjoy it for exactly the same \nreasons. \n____________________________\n\n 1. The BC-52s - (Meet) The Flintstones (Freds Edit)   \n    Producer - Don Was\n  \n 2.
