In &quot;Chechen Jihad&quot;, Bodansky draws on previously unseen intelligence from his insider sources, to offer the most comprehensive-and startling-portrait of the Chechenization phenomenon and what it means for the war on terror. As he reveals, the final years of US-Soviet relations left Chechnya as a fertile breeding ground for the mujahadin, and in the past decade a combination of militant native Chechen anti-Americans, anti-Russian agitators, and Middle Eastern jihadis have joined forces to help al Qaeda and the greater Islamist movement pursue its war against the west.As Bodansky points out, &quot;the Chechens are professional fighters- disciplined and responsible, with a combination of skills, expertise, and character that has made them the most sought-after 'force multipliers' in the movement.&quot; Authoritative in its detail, chilling in its implications, &quot;Chechen Jihad&quot; is a book no one with an interest in the future of the West should miss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fa38db9bfc9020ef453cbed4964947a550127f","amp;dn":"Chechen+Jihad%3A+Al+Qaeda%27s+Training+Ground+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fa38db9bfc9020ef453cbed4964947a550127f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,250,56,219,155,252,144,32,239,69,60,190,212,150,73,71,165,80,18,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
