It's a movie full of oily, ugly people in rubber costumes giving intense, whispered inner monologues. It's a movie without a recognizable narrative structure! Either you love this movie like Noah does, or you'll suffer through Lindsay's personal gom jabbar (whatever that is).\n\nIt's one of the strangest sci-fi bombs out there. At least you can safely say there's nothing else quite like Dune...and there's a few good reasons for that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:612d6c12ac4524f5d0de4c0e3f315d9e315f1a1f","amp;dn":"Spoony+and+the+Nostalgia+Chick+-+Dune+%282004%29+Rifftrax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"612d6c12ac4524f5d0de4c0e3f315d9e315f1a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,45,108,18,172,69,36,245,208,222,76,14,63,49,93,158,49,95,26,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
