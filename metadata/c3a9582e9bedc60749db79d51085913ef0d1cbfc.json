Atmospheric, fantastical, tragic and hopeful, the film chronicles the parallel fates of Jacqueline, a young mother with a disabled son in 1960s Paris, and Antoine, a recently divorced, successful DJ in present day Montreal. What binds the two stories together is love - euphoric, obsessive, tragic, youthful, timeless love. -- (C) Official Site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3a9582e9bedc60749db79d51085913ef0d1cbfc","amp;dn":"Cafe+de+Flore+2011+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3a9582e9bedc60749db79d51085913ef0d1cbfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,169,88,46,155,237,198,7,73,219,121,213,16,133,145,62,240,209,203,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
