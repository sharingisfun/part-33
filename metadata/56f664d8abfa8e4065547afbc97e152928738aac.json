(as in &quot;realizing every dream&quot;) is Ne-Yo's fifth album and first for Motown -- a revitalized label that, earlier in the year, named the artist its Senior Vice President of A&amp;R. It also follows Ne-Yo's featured appearances on two of the year's biggest radio hits, Pitbull's &quot;Give Me Everything&quot; and Young Jeezy's &quot;Leave You Alone.&quot; The album's &quot;Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)&quot; features songwriting input from Sia Furler, while Ne-Yo's Compound Entertainment associates Phatboiz, fresh from their work on Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, chip in with some productions. Ne-Yo continues to embrace dance-pop while maintaining his connection to R&amp;B.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tMotown Records\nCatalog:\t\tB0017739-02\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Cracks In Mr. Perfect\n02.Lazy Love\n03.Let Me Love You (Until You Learn To Love Yourself)\n04.Miss Right\n05.Jealous\n06.Don't Make 'Em Like You (Feat.
