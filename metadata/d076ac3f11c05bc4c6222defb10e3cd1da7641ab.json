Fasteau attains another remarkable\r\nachievement of stylistic and timbral breadth, in a first-time collaboration\r\nwith tenor saxophonist (and New Orleans native) Kidd Jordan and percussionist\r\nMichael T.A. Thompson. Fasteau is renowned for mastering a multitude of\r\ninstruments and for her ability to improvise within formats ranging from\r\ntightly structured postbop to spontaneous, reductionist free jazz. Here she\r\nopts for piano, cello, soprano sax, Nai flute and Aquasonic (a bowed metal jug)\r\nto convey the struggles and uncertaintyâ€”and hopefully, the ultimate\r\nredemptionâ€”of the residents of New Orleansâ€™ Ninth Ward, where Jordan and his\r\nfamily lived amongst thousands of others whose homes became buried under the\r\nGulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nRecorded in New Orleans on the late night of Sept. 25, 2005, mere weeks after\r\nHurricane Katrina devastated the city, People of the Ninth sonically transposes\r\nthe tumultuous emotions experienced by Jordan as he braved the destruction with\r\nhis family, watching others become horrifically neglected and denied. Fasteau\r\ntaps deeply into this well of emotion and mania, at times mimicking underwater\r\nsounds with the Aquasonic, creating the illusion of entrapment and\r\ndrowning. Jordanâ€™s horn cries for the unfortunate and angrily admonishes the\r\nuncaring. The titles (e.g. â€œLevees, Lies &amp; Lives,â€ â€œRising Winds,â€ â€œRescue\r\nDenied,â€ â€œConcentration Domeâ€) chronologically tell this tragic tale, and the\r\nmusic does even more so.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy AAJ Staff \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/people-of-the-ninth-new-orleans-and-the-hurricane-2005-kali-z-fasteau-flying-note-records-review-by-aaj-staff.php\r\n\r\nBy Budd Kopman \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/people-of-the-ninth-new-orleans-and-the-hurricane-2005-kali-z-fasteau-flying-note-records-review-by-budd-kopman.php\r\n\r\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\r\n\r\nPor Eduardo Chagas (pt)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d076ac3f11c05bc4c6222defb10e3cd1da7641ab","amp;dn":"Kali.+Z.+Fasteau%2C+Kidd+Jordan+-+People+of+the+Ninth+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d076ac3f11c05bc4c6222defb10e3cd1da7641ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,118,172,63,17,192,91,196,198,34,45,239,177,14,60,209,218,118,65,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
