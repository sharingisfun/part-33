Not all will connect in a logical way but that doesn't matter to him. He can still dream...\n\nYou have 22 tiles to place in your principality. Like Carcassonne and other path-building tile-laying games, Don Quixote requires timely decisions and risk-taking with a twist: instead of choosing where to place your next tile, the game chooses the location and you choose which tile to place there! \n\nConnect your principality's roads to protect its castles and borders with knights, and link your churches and windmills to score points.\nFeaturing achievement levels to unlock the two expansions: Sancho Pansa and Veto.\nWith original illustrations by Oliver Freudenreich.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- added Russian/Ukrainian\n- fixed minor issues\n--------------\n- added German/Spanish\n- fixed rendering on some devices\n- other bug fixes\n- Fixed layout issues for Razr devices\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=donquixote.android&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=donquixote.android&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cb87c208ab789563f465b5b443fcb72a0fe0ff5","amp;dn":"Don+Quixote+v1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cb87c208ab789563f465b5b443fcb72a0fe0ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,184,124,32,138,183,137,86,63,70,91,91,68,63,203,114,160,254,15,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
