I am not the original creator of the torrent, Im just reposting it here, so I cant vouch for the quality.  The second doctor seems to have the most damage to its archives.  Many of the episodes are audio-only with picture stills or poor video quality.  Ive taken the liberty of breaking up my huge 200+ gig torrent of the first 7 doctors into bite-size torrents of the different doctors.  Also organizing the episodes and cleaning up the names a bit.  Ill put up as many docs as space permits.  When I see that at least 5 people have all of a doc, Ill stop seeding that doc and put up a new one.  So, the more you seed them, the sooner Ill put up the next one!
