Mel TormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s &quot;It's Easy to Remember,&quot; Rosemary Clooney's &quot;When October Goes,&quot; George Shearing's &quot;My Favorite Things,&quot; and Stefan Scaggiari's &quot;If I Could&quot; are some of the highlights of this affordable collection of smoky, sentimental jazz. ~ Heather Phares, AMG\n\nIt's really a shame that there is no music sampler available for this collection as for others in the Jazz Moods series! Jazz lovers could then hear a nicely-melded collection of quiet, introspective music by such favorites as the incomparable Karrin Allyson, Marian McPartland and Scott Hamilton. &quot;Sentimental&quot; is not, I feel, an accurate description of this cd's overall mood. The songs are emotionally moving, especially Mary Stallings' gentle, soulful rendition of Clapton's &quot;Tears in Heaven.&quot; An excellent styling by Rosemary Clooney of a Johnny Mercer/Barry Manalow &quot;When October Goes&quot; is not to be missed. Also, Stefan Scaggiari plays an unforgetable piano version of Pat Metheny's composition, &quot;If I Could.&quot; Late nights, rainy days, solitary autumn afternoons - these are the times best suited for experiencing &quot;Jazz Moods' Feeling Sentimental.&quot; ~ K.
