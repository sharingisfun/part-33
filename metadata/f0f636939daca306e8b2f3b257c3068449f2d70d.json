Mount it or burn it then watch it or sleep thru it. It is all there with menus but NO directors track in any of them... Maybe an occasional bonus special.\nAlso there is NO alternate language tracks or subtitles. They spent very little to none to produce these.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMore SG1 seasons will be forthcoming soon..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f636939daca306e8b2f3b257c3068449f2d70d","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+4+Disk+1+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f636939daca306e8b2f3b257c3068449f2d70d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,246,54,147,157,172,163,6,232,178,243,178,87,195,6,132,73,242,215,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
