Though the host of MSNBCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PoliticsNation is as fiery and outspoken\nas ever about the events and issues that matter most, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned that the only way we can get\nright as a nation is by getting right from within. In this, his first book in over a decade,\nReverend Al will take you behind the scenes of some unÃ‚Â­expected places Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from officiating Michael\nJackÃ‚Â­sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funeral, hanging out with Jay-Z and PresiÃ‚Â­dent Barack Obama at the White House, to\ntaking charge of the Trayvon Martin case. And he will discuss how he came to his unexpected\nconclusions in such areas as immigration, gay rights, religion and the family. But the heart of\nthis book is an intimate discusÃ‚Â­sion of his own personal evolution from street activist, pulpit\nprovocateur and civil rights leader to the man he is today Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one hundred pounds slimÃ‚Â­mer, and\naccording to the New York Observer, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most thoughtful voice on cable.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ No, the Reverend Al you\nmet ten years ago isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the same man youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet today. And he has a simple promise. We can\ntransform this nation and we can all lead better lives if weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re willing to transform our hearts\nand transform our minds.\n\n\nThe Rejected Stone:\nAl Sharpton and the Path to American Leadership\nby Al Sharpton\nISBN:1936399474\n(ISBN13:9781936399475)\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage EN\nPages: 390","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1330f7a56b213eb84a149c0cc11978165e476ff","amp;dn":"The+Rejected+Stone+Al+Sharpton+and+the+Path+to+American+Leadersh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1330f7a56b213eb84a149c0cc11978165e476ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,51,15,122,86,178,19,235,132,161,73,192,204,17,151,129,101,228,118,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
