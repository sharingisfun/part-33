The New Mastersounds were formed in 1999 by guitarist Eddie Roberts, who was DJ'ing at a weekly club night in Leeds devoted to classic soul and funk. When the event moved to a new venue that covered two floors, Roberts saw the opportunity to add a live band to the mix, and he recruited drummer Simon Allen, who had previously played with Roberts in a band called the Mastersounds. With the addition of Pete Shand on bass and Bob Birch on piano and organ, the new act was complete and in tribute to their old group, Roberts and Allen dubbed the combo the New Mastersounds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a2b426684b8c0635cba8b5113820926de5f0938","amp;dn":"Eddie+Roberts+%26amp%3B+The+New+Mastersounds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a2b426684b8c0635cba8b5113820926de5f0938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,43,66,102,132,184,192,99,92,186,139,81,19,130,9,38,222,95,9,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
