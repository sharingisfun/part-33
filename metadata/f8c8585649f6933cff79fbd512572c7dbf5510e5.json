P. J. Abdul Kalam (The WEEK - Special Issue Cover story)\nEnglish | 9th August 2015 | PDF | 39 pages | 29.8 mb\n\nDr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen &quot;A. P. J.&quot; Abdul Kalam was India's most popular president. He was the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He passed away on 27 July 2015 at the age of 83. \nHe spent the four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s civilian space program and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and political role in IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.\nKalam was widely referred to as Ã¢â‚¬Å“PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s PresidentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. He died after he collapsed from an apparent cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong on 27 July 2015, aged 83.\n&quot;The WEEK&quot;, a popular weekly current affairs magazine published a special issue on 9th August 2015 to commemorate him.
