I bundled them together giving them thumbnails and all that etcÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ See the Read Me for any changes.\n\nI had to do this in RAR format due to the fact there are too many files to post in their original mp3 format. I posted in parts so each session can be accessed while waiting for the other sections to download.\n\nSome collections are released and some aren't. They are for your informational purposes. If you want the original sources they're out there. (If you have the money to burn) I guess Elvis fans are still being bled to this day. It certainly is not for Elvis or the ambitious show people of his time. I guess thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s showbiz though.\n\nSorry itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not FLAC. MP3 was their posted format.\n\nIf you know of any more postings of alternate or Master &amp; Session collections that are uniquely different than these here, you can leave the info below at the pirate bay page. The info would be much appreciated.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nThese are Master &amp; Session, Outtakes, Alternate Versions, and a few live recordings.\n\n01 Sun Record 53-55\n02 Acetate 55\n03 Vintage March 55\n04 RCA Recording Jan 56\n05 Shake That Miss...
