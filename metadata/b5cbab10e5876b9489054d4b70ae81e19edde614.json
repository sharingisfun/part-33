I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.\n\nSo feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5cbab10e5876b9489054d4b70ae81e19edde614","amp;dn":"V+2009+S01E09+HQ+HDTV+AC3+DivX+%28Re-Encode+From+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5cbab10e5876b9489054d4b70ae81e19edde614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,203,171,16,229,135,107,148,137,5,77,75,112,174,129,225,158,221,230,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
