The tiny village of Slapton is told that it has to be evacuated - American troops are occupying the wide district of South Devon. Over three thousand inhabitants must uproot themselves from their homes in less than a fortnight. The Americans are performing advanced manoeuvres with real bullets - a good reason for civilians to be evacuated. They're prepared for animosity, but they're not prepared for the harsh conditions the war in Europe has imposed upon the civilian population of England; the short supply of almost everything is a far cry from the luxuries of home. Reissued in the time for the fiftieth anniversary of the D-Day landings, The Magic Army is vintage Leslie Thomas. Charming, funny and imbued with warmth, he writes about the events leading up to that fateful day with his trademark compassion. A must for all fans of Leslie Thomas.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf5d94595aff489fe3ed76b4639b9f416cc36056","amp;dn":"The+Magic+Army+-+Leslie+Thomas+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf5d94595aff489fe3ed76b4639b9f416cc36056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,93,148,89,90,255,72,159,227,237,118,180,99,155,159,65,108,195,96,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
