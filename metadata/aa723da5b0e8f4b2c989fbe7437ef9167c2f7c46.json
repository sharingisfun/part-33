Pretty sure it can be read on Windows if you get an EPUB reader (assuming it doesn't have one built-in, IDK, I don't use Windows.)\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please seed as my upload speed is rubbish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa723da5b0e8f4b2c989fbe7437ef9167c2f7c46","amp;dn":"The+Outsider+%26ndash%3B+Albert+Camus%2C+Sandra+Smith+%5BEPUB%5D%5BMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa723da5b0e8f4b2c989fbe7437ef9167c2f7c46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,114,61,165,176,232,244,178,201,137,251,231,67,126,249,22,124,47,124,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
