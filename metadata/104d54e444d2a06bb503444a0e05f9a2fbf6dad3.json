The story has been distorted not only by Cold War propaganda but also by the myths of the nineteenth century Great Game. It moves from the high politics of the Kremlin to the lonely Russian conscripts in isolated mountain outposts. The parallels with Afghanistan today speak for themselves.Ã¢â‚¬ËœA superb achievement of narrative history, sensitive writing and exciting fresh researchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢: so wrote Simon Sebag Montefiore about Rodric BraithwaiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestseller Moscow 1941. But those words, and many others of praise that were given it, could equally apply to his new book.\n \nAbout the Author:\n\nRodric Braithwaite was British Ambassador to Moscow during the crucial years of 1988-92. Subsequently he was foreign policy advisor to John Major. His books include Across the Moscow River and the highly praised and bestselling Moscow 1941 (Profile).
