Hunter, an award-winning journalist, is the producer and creator of USAWatchdog.com. The siteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slogan is &quot;analyzing the news to give you a clear picture of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really going on.&quot; The site claims to keep an eye on the government, your financial interests and cut through corporate media spin. \n\nAlex also covers the prospect of National Guard troops once again deployed on the streets in New Orleans and other important news stories.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
