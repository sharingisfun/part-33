Rick takes us on a citrus groove to learn the ins and outs of fresh juice in savory, lip-smacking dishes throughout the Yucatan. We journey to the huge citrus market in Oxkutzkab for a sweet and sour lesson on the lime family treeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from limÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n to lima the classic aromatic citrus fruit used to make Sopa de Lima (Classic Yucatecan Lime Soup with crispy tortillas). Lanie teaches Rick a thing or two about the local avocadoes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from the Noche Buena variety to the Lagunero. At home, they make an Avocado-Mango Salad with a fresh lime juice and pumpkinseed dressing. Then Rick takes us to Tutul Xiu Restaurant in the small town of ManÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­ for their renowned Poc ChucÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½quick-grilled thin pieces of pork marinated in sour orange and served with all kinds of crunchy garnishes. At home, Rick roasts whole sweet onions in the embers and then grills the pork over mesquite for a savory citrus dinner that never fails to enchant.
