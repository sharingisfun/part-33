Schulz, which ran from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. The strip is the most popular and influential in the history of the comic strip, with 17,897 strips published in all. At its peak, Peanuts ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of 355 million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States, and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion.\n \nPeanuts is regarded as one of the most influential and well-written comic strips of all time. Schulz received the National Cartoonist Society Humor Comic Strip Award for Peanuts in 1962; the Reuben Award in 1955 and 1964; the Elzie Segar Award in 1980; and the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. \n \nConsidered amongst the greatest comic strips of all time, Peanuts was declared second in a list of the greatest comics of the 20th century commissioned by The Comics Journal in 1999. Peanuts lost out to George Herriman's Krazy Kat.\n \nThis torrent contains ALL the strips published by Schulz from 1950 - 2000.\n\nI was very surprised to not find these classics already on TPB somewhere, so I searched multiple times before I submiited my humble torrent.  I apologize for any redundancy.\n\nEnjoy, and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b321ebb34e786c6e273a865ae7bc3c25895f022e","amp;dn":"Peanuts+%28Complete%29+%28No+ads%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b321ebb34e786c6e273a865ae7bc3c25895f022e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,33,235,179,78,120,108,110,39,58,134,90,231,188,60,37,137,95,2,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
