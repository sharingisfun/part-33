The series was about two toads, Toro and Pancho (&quot;Pancho y Rancho&quot; in the Spanish-language version, and &quot;Sancho und Pancho&quot; in the German version), who live in the Mexican city of Tijuana. Throughout the cartoon they try to eat their prey, but always get out-smarted. They would sometimes themselves be targeted by a bird, and would in turn always out-smart him.\n\nFriz Frieling had a lot to do with these cartoons, if that name sounds familiar, it&amp;#039;s because he produced a large number of Looney Tunes &amp; Merrie Melodies shorts for warner brothers. In 1976, NBC edited Tijuana Toads and renamed it Texas Toads to make the series less offensive. The toads&amp;#039; new names were Fatso and Banjo. (BOOO!)\n\nAll these are original TIJUANA toads.\n\nI love these old racially &quot;offensive&quot; time-pieces, and this one is a classic. The art, the backround jazz, all screams 60s-70s animation.
