The epic Record of Agarest War series continues with this prequel that takes you further back in the ancient war between darkness and light. Follow the heroic Sieghart, who must assemble a magical tool and free the only one who can turn the tide for the forces of light. Once again, you'll shape the destiny of the next generation with the unique Soul-Breeding System, where your character's child picks up the story. Use a new Card Skill System character, experience new living character portraits, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4777f2b35b156efb248f6793cd2d3840ff6044b5","amp;dn":"Record+of+Agarest+War+Zero+NTSC%2FU+NTSC%2FJ+Xbox+360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4777f2b35b156efb248f6793cd2d3840ff6044b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,119,242,179,91,21,110,251,36,143,103,147,205,45,56,64,255,96,68,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
