With vocalist Don Dokken's captivating stage presence and guitarist George Lynch's high-energy style, the band combined rockers such as &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; and power ballads such as &quot;Alone Again&quot; in order to create a number of best-selling albums. Dokken's roots date back to the late '70s, when Lynch, along with drummer Mick Brown, teamed up with Don Dokken to form the Boyz. In 1981, Don moved to Germany and was signed to Carerre Records. The band, now simply known as Dokken, recorded and released Breaking the Chains, their first studio album, in 1983. While the record failed to retain a decent chart position in the United States, the group was immensely popular in Europe. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tFrontiers Records\nCatalog:\t\tFRCD 567\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.73% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Empire\n02.Broken Bones\n03.Best Of Me\n04.Blind\n05.Waterfall\n06.The Victim Of The Crime\n07.Burning Tears\n08.Today\n09.For The Last Time\n10.Fade Away\n11.Tonight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ad620855fa790d22df2b5852ef70f9e60c377d1","amp;dn":"Dokken+-+Broken+Bones+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ad620855fa790d22df2b5852ef70f9e60c377d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,214,32,133,95,167,144,210,45,242,181,133,46,247,15,158,96,195,119,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
