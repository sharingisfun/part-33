The first chapter provides a detailed historical introduction to the subject, while subsequent chapters offer a quantitative presentation of the Standard Model. A simplified introduction to the Feynman rules, based on a &quot;toy&quot; model, helps readers learn the calculational techniques without the complications of spin. It is followed by accessible treatments of quantum electrodynamics, the strong and weak interactions, and gauge theories. New chapters address neutrino oscillations and prospects for physics beyond the Standard Model. The book contains a number of worked examples and many end-of-chapter problems. A complete solution manual is available for instructors.\n\n* Revised edition of a well-established text on elementary particle physics\n* With a number of worked examples and many end-of-chapter problems\n* Helps the student to master the Feynman rules\n* Solution manual available for instructors\n\nAbout the Author\nDavid J. Griffiths (born 1942) is a U.S. physicist and educator. He has worked at Reed College since 1978, where he is currently the Howard Vollum Professor of Science. He is not to be confused with the late physicist David J. Griffiths of Oregon State University. Griffiths is a graduate of The Putney School and was trained at Harvard University (B.A., 1964; M.A., 1966; Ph.D., 1970). He is principally known as the author of three highly regarded textbooks for undergraduate physics students:\n- Introduction to Elementary Particles (published in 1987, second edition published 2008),\n- Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (published in 1995, second edition published 2004), and\n- Introduction to Electrodynamics (published in 1981, third edition published 1999.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e0b882d46a6d6a6bd01fe1658f11780568a96dd","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Elementary+Particles+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e0b882d46a6d6a6bd01fe1658f11780568a96dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,11,136,45,70,166,214,166,189,1,254,22,88,241,23,128,86,138,150,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
