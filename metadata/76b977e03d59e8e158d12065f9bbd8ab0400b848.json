The descendant of the woman he wanted to marry already has a boyfriend: a brave young boy named Cody, who lives with his swindler uncle Morty and together they run a tour company called Darkside Tours. Leprechaun soon wakes up, kills a bunch of people and kidnaps his bride to be. It's soon up to Cody to save her, and only wrought iron can destroy a Leprechaun. Morty has an idea, but it soon goes horribly wrong when he gets too greedy. Cody ventures into Leprechaun's home to save Bridget, but little does he know that a leprechaun's home has many surprises.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b977e03d59e8e158d12065f9bbd8ab0400b848","amp;dn":"Leprechaun.2.%5B1994%5D.DVDRip.XviD-BLiTZKRiEG.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b977e03d59e8e158d12065f9bbd8ab0400b848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,185,119,224,61,89,232,225,88,209,32,101,249,187,216,171,4,0,184,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
