Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to respond.\n\nThen, Newt Gingrich of all people warned Republicans to quit hostage taking, but another big time senator refused the advice.\n\nEd went in-depth on the Republican deception about the debt. First, he checked with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) about how Democrats are fighting back.\n\nThen, Eugene Robinson (MSNBC Analyst and Associate Editor and Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the Washington Post), and Howard Fineman (NBC News Political Analyst and Editorial Director of the Huffington Post Media Group), discussed which party has the upper hand in negotiations.\n\n67 House Republicans voted against disaster relief for New York and New Jersey residents. Ed detailed the shame of Paul Ryan and his heartless &quot;Sandy 67&quot; gang with Lizz Winstead (comedian and co-creator of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;).\n\nFormer Rep. Barney Frank says he wants to be the next U.S. senator from Massachusetts. Ed will tell us why this is an outstanding idea.\n\nAnd in the BIG Finish, Bill O'Reilly does his best Archie Bunker, claiming &quot;Asian people are not liberal by nature. They're usually more industrious and hardworking.&quot; Legendary actor and author George Takei responded to the Fox News host.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:578a48d42b74f0b56f0dfc2d7dc33878502f1118","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+1-4-13.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"578a48d42b74f0b56f0dfc2d7dc33878502f1118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,138,72,212,43,116,240,181,111,13,252,45,125,195,56,120,80,47,17,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
