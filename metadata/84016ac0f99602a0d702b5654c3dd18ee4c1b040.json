After the two crossed paths again in 2002, Palin met vocalist Katja Rimpelainen and presented the idea to her of singing alongside him in a metal band.  Upon acquiring guitarist Mikko Tuliniemi (Hallowed), drummer Timo Peltokangas (also Hallowed) and bassist Jukko Koponen, the band officially assumed the name Random Eyes.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - July 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84016ac0f99602a0d702b5654c3dd18ee4c1b040","amp;dn":"Random+Eyes+Discography+2003-2011+%283+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84016ac0f99602a0d702b5654c3dd18ee4c1b040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,1,106,192,249,150,2,160,215,2,181,101,76,61,209,142,228,193,176,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
