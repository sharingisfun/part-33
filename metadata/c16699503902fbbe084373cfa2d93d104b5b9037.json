Colo(u)r me disillusioned! Around the time that Simon Pegg (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End, How To Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People, Mission Impossible 4, Run Fatboy Run, Star Trek etc etc) was making a name for himself via SPACED, he was also in this show with Darren Boyd (Christmas At The Riviera, Dirk Gently, Green Wing, Holy Flying Circus, Magicians, Saxondale, Whites etc etc), Julian Rhind-Tutt (Black Books, Green Wing, Notting Hill, Tomb Raider, A Touch Of Cloth etc etc) and Sally Phillips (who was in an Aussie fillum called Boytown with some guy called Bob Franklin who I created a Facebook page for).
