CAPCOM is the latest installment of Capcom's STREET FIGHTER series. But now gamers will be able to play as brawlers from the far reaches of the Capcom universe, spanning games like STREET FIGHTER, MEGA MAN, and CONTRA. Marvel is represented by new additions like Venom and Onslaught, as well as fighting-game staples Spider-Man and Wolverine. Capcom's lineup includes Street Fighters Ryu, Chun Li, and Zangief, but also non-fighting game characters like Captain Commando and Mega Man. The result is a veritable smorgasbord of fighters from all over the place. This mix of comic book heroes and videogame characters gives the game a diverse feel, but the gameplay will feel familiar to fans of STREET FIGHTER and other Capcom fighting games.\n\nRelease Date: January 27, 2000\nT for Teen: Animated Violence\nGenre: Fighting\nPublisher: Capcom\nDeveloper: Capcom\n\nSupported Functions\nNumber Of Players: 1-2\nVibration\nMemory Card\nMemory Blocks: 1 block\n\nPlay as characters from the Capcom and Marvel universes; includes characters from a wide array of games; all of the characters have unique fighting styles\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cf8794604d54c0e5def41f9d690b90f59dcd4a4","amp;dn":"Marvel+vs.+Capcom+Clash+of+Super+Heroes+PS1+NTSC%2FU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cf8794604d54c0e5def41f9d690b90f59dcd4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,248,121,70,4,213,76,14,93,239,65,249,214,144,185,15,89,220,212,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
