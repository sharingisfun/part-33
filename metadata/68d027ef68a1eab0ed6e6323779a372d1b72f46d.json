A timeless novel as urgently compelling as War Day or Alas, Babylon, David Brin's The Postman is the dramatically moving saga of a man who rekindled the spirit of America through the power of a dream, from a modern master of science fiction.\n\nHe was a survivor--a wanderer who traded tales for food and shelter in the dark and savage aftermath of a devastating war.  Fate touches him one chill winter's day when he borrows the jacket of a long-dead postal worker to protect himself from the cold.  The old, worn uniform still has power as a symbol of hope, and with it he begins to weave his greatest tale, of a nation on the road to recovery.\n\nRead by Ralph Bargs\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68d027ef68a1eab0ed6e6323779a372d1b72f46d","amp;dn":"David+Brin+-+The+Postman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68d027ef68a1eab0ed6e6323779a372d1b72f46d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,208,39,239,104,161,234,176,237,110,99,35,119,154,55,45,27,114,244,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
