This book shows how the concepts of &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;the religions&quot; arose from controversies in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. The birth of &quot;the religions,&quot; conceived of as sets of beliefs and practices, created a new science of religion in which the various &quot;religions&quot; could be studied and impartially compared. Harrison gives a detailed historical picture of the emergence of this concept and how it led to the discipline of comparative religion.&quot;\n\nReview:\n&quot;Professor Harrison has produced a meticulously documented, systematically organized, and challenging monograph. His use of the printed literature and sources of the period is exemplary. Although a demanding exercise in intellectual history, this book is profoundly significant for scholars concerned with English religious thought.&quot; --Albion\n\nThis torrent contains the original scanned PDF, and all attempts to convert it successfully into other formats failed to produce a readable copy.
