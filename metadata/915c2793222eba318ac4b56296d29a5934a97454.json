As Jimmy explains it \\&quot;when you are coming up on the streets you got to hustle to survive or else you\\&amp;#039;ll be left out in\nthis cold world.  That\\&amp;#039;s all we got and that\\&amp;#039;s what my music depicts.  It depicts stories of everybody comin\\&amp;#039; up. Sometime it\\&amp;#039;s hopeless, but you\ngot to stay focused. We on the street corners doing the daily, and that\\&amp;#039;s what we call hustlin\\&amp;#039;. Stay tuned for some powerful music.  Your boy,\nJones.\\&quot;\n\nThe Diplomats have become the household definition of hustling, and Jimmy brings his hustle to life with Hustler\\&amp;#039;s P.O.M.E.  The streets-\nproclaimed \\&quot;Dipset Capo\\&quot; takes the Diplomat movement to new levels with his charismatic swagger, gritty lyrical realism, and head-nodding\nproduction.  With guest appearances from The Diplomats, Lil\\&amp;#039; Wayne, Baby and many more, Hustler\\&amp;#039;s P.O.M.E. is sure to bang in every hood and\nevery block.
