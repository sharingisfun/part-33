Doomsday is upon us, and any remaining survivors\nare living in a post-apocalyptic world of desolate landscapes that they\nare eager to rebuild. Or so dubstep duo and apparent disaster movie\nenthusiasts Nero would have you believe on their debut album Welcome\nReality.\n\nSure, it\\'s a curious and not wholly original concept that wreaks of\nself-indulgence, but when your business is to rework this year\\'s genre\nof choice by mainstream pop acts into something fresh and exciting,\nit\\'s also one that happens to work very well.\n\nIt\\'s clear from the wobbling basslines of \\'Guilt\\' and strobing synths\nin \\'Promises\\' that they\\'ve paid close attention to label bosses Chase &amp;\nStatus on treading the tightrope between commercial dubstep and\nunderground drum \\'n\\' bass, but it\\'s when they cut loose with\nthunderous, hook-laden \\'Doomsday\\' and the sledge-hammering guitar on\n\\'Scorpions\\' that they really come into their own.\n\nWhile they quickly lose sight of their ambitious concept, Welcome\nReality is nonetheless an exhilarating ensemble of euphoric breakdowns\nand club-thumping choruses - the best of which feature long-standing\nguest vocalist Alana Watson at the helm. Someone sign these two up to\nsoundtrack Blade Runner II post-haste.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:273f9b1f6d632dd71741dc2017e93d535240bfad","amp;dn":"Nero-Welcome_Reality-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"273f9b1f6d632dd71741dc2017e93d535240bfad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,63,155,31,109,99,45,215,23,65,220,32,23,233,61,83,82,64,191,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
