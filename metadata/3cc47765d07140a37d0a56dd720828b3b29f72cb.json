Nite City could be seen as RayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tin Machine, \na band of equal parts doomed to stunted development in the shadow of the monument erected to \nThe Doors. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re determined to effect a comparison between the two, vocalist Noah JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \nmusings on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNite CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ vaguely evoke Morrison, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBitter Sky BlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLove StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nfiltered through Mott the Hoople, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAngel W/ No FreedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has some of the dark dream imagery \nlast seen on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRiders of the Storm.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The clarion call of organ at the onset of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummer EyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nwould seem to promise more, but in fact thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no reason to come knockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ here for flashbacks \nof The Doors beyond the presence of Manzarek. Nite City is closer in style to The Tubes, Mott, \neven a little Aerosmith in Noah JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ vocals. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s theatrical rock some of the time, plain \nold faceless rock the rest of it, and nothing that 1977 hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen before done better. The \nband still would have warranted a contract even without The Doors connection (hell, Baby Grand \ngot one with less), but the lack of a strong musical identity would have been their eventual \nundoing anyway.\n\n&quot;Golden Days Diamond Nights&quot;, was the second &amp; final album from Ray Manzarek's post DOORS \nband NITE CITY. Following their self-titled 1977 debut, the band dispensed with the services \nof their singer Noah James, with guitarist Paul Warren taking the lion's share of vocal duties \non their sophomore disc. Manzarek himself also handles lead vocals on two tracks, but neither \nof the pair had distinctive enough vocals to elevate the album to the heights of it's \npredecessor. Their U.S. label shelved the record after hearing the results, but it was \nreleased in West Germany where the debut LP had been a reasonable success. Frustrated by their \nlack of headway, bassist Nigel Harrison accepted an offer to join BLONDIE, and despite \ndraughting in a replacement for a short tour, the writing was on the wall for Nite City, and \nthe band folded soon after. Drummer Jimmy Hunter went on to play with FLO &amp; EDDIE and \nSTEPPENWOLF, becoming a respected session musician. Paul Warren became a long time \nROD STEWART sideman and Manzarek forged ahead with a moderately sucessful career in \nproduction, with X being a notable success for him in this field.\n\nRay Manzarek's spoken word story &quot;The Doors Myth and Reality&quot; the story of himself and \nThe Doors is quite thorough, with many good vignettes. In addition to putting a lot of \nemotion into their music, The Doors incorporated a lot of intelligence, and Ray supplies \nthe background. Blues (and some jazz and classical) for Ray, film and literary (ranging \nfrom French literature/poetry to Beat poetry) for both him and Jim Morrison. Ray speaks in \nglowing terms of the old blues masters like Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon \n(author of &quot;Backdoor Man&quot;) and how they influenced him and The Doors. Contrary to Oliver \nStone's portrayal, Jim Morrison graduated from UCLA Film School, but Ray's films did better \nduring that time. This double CD does not provide a narrative treatment of the mainstream \nDoors years, which would be no novelty; there are selected very interesting stories about Jim, \nwith no cheap sensationalism, and which by no means dominate. There is also much more, with \noccasional focus on the studio and the stage. As to Ray's account of Jim's death, is it clear \nwhat position he is taking--that is, is it myth or reality?\n\nRay Manzarek - The Golden Scarab (1974)\nMore than Full Circle and Other Voices, The Golden Scarab is the best embodiment of the Doors \nby one of the three surviving members, and it is amazing it wasn't a huge underground smash. \nWith mentions of moonlight drives, tightrope rides, and titles of past Doors tunes in &quot;The Solar \nBoat,&quot; drummer Tony Williams, guitarist Larry Carlton, bassist Jerry Scheff, and producer \nBruce Botnick generate an eerie sound behind the singer, creating a title track as mysterious \nand fun as anything by Morrison and company. With intense rhythms and tons of creativity, \nRay Manzarek brings us on a musical journey as unique as The Phantom's Divine Comedy, and if \nRobbie Krieger brought the commercial element to the Doors' gravy train, it is clear here that \nthe eldest of the quartet had more a hand in the development of the Doors persona than he \nmay have been given credit for. One can't fault Krieger and John Densmore for stretching out \nwith Butts Band, but there is a certain responsibility hit artists should have to their \naudience. The Bright Midnight releases finally address those concerns, but decades before \nthe opening of the Doors tape vaults, that sound from L.A. Woman was most obvious on \n&quot;The Purpose of Existence Is?&quot; on this solo effort. Yes, Ray Manzarek veers off into his \njazz leanings; given the players on this, how could he not? But he gives enough of a taste of \npast glories to make The Golden Scarab accessible, spoon feeding his musical styles to those \nwho couldn't get enough of the music he was associated with. It's dramatic and cohesive, \nmaking more sense than Jim Morrison much of the time, with more controlled insanity. It is \namazing that such a fine work as The Golden Scarab escaped the masses, and shameful that \nclassic hits stations don't add this to their incessant repertoire. Had Jim Morrison lived, \nthis is the path the music of the Doors should have taken. Smooth and demanding of \nrepeated spins. ~ Joe Viglione, All Music Guide\n\nRay Manzarek &amp; Roy Rogers - Ballads Before the Rain (2008)\nThe legendary co-founder of The Doors, Ray Manzarek and the critically acclaimed slide/blues \nguitarist Roy Rogers have put their artistic minds together and have truly created a \ncaptivating new duet album for Friday Music entitled Ballads Before The Rain.......The nine \ninstrumental works that make up this debut album are sonically some of the finest recordings \nto be released this year, and we are very proud to have both of these fine gentlemen on \nboard with this incredible new release.......Audiophile fanatics and fans alike will truly \ndig the amazing new takes on Doors classics like The Crystal Ship and Riders On The Storm, \nas well as the other blues/jazz/classical tracks that define the utmost level of \nmusicianship that each of these award winning composers/producers/performers display. The \nmuch emulated keyboard technique of Ray Manzarek and Roy Rogers solid guitar work carry on \nthroughout all of the works contained on this debut release. Not foreign to the classics, \nthe two even combine their talents and visit Eric Satie s Gnossienne No. 1 as well as deep \nblue etchings from Roy Rogers himself on Remembering You and Ruby Red Nails. Ray Manzarek \nand Roy Rogers- Ballads Before The Rain....This historic meeting is now waxed and ready for \ntheir legions of collective fans to enjoy. A session fit for a king indeed!\n\nThe Whole Thing Started with Rock &amp; Roll and Now It's Out of Control (1974/2005)\nOriginally released in 1974, the full title is: \nWhole Thing Started With Rock &amp; Roll, Now It's Out Of Control. This release is digitally \nremastered and on CD for the first time. Features the track 'Wake Up Screaming' a poem \nwritten by Jim Morrison which features Patti Smith on vocals. Album also includes Joe Walsh \nof the Eagles and Dick Wagner who worked with Lou Reed. Lemon. 2005.\n\nLove Her Madly (2006)\nThe evocative and eclectic instrumental score to the Ray Manzarek directed film, \n&quot;Love Her Madly&quot; features Ray with composer Bruce Hanifan, and includes an appearance from \nfellow Doors alumni Robby Krieger. As Ray himself said about the score, &quot;have a glass of wine \nand put your ears on it.&quot; Look for him on tour as both solo artist and as part of \nRiders On The Storm. This album was released in 2006 and is an update of the soundtrack for \nhis low budget movie of the same name. It is 54 minutes long and the sound quality is excellent.\nThis is simply a fantastic album (and I don't give out 5 stars easily). It is deep, rich, and \nsometimes spacy music. It is always very interesting and there is not a bad moment on it. The \nmusic is like an evolution of the Doors sound. There are bits that will remind you of the \nDoors, especially The End. This is mostly an instrumental CD, with some spacy talking on one \ntrack. As you would expect, it is keyboard driven but there are some interesting guitar \nparts (from Robby Kreiger) and some sax and some vocals (but no singing). It is hard to \nexplain, but think of taking the best parts of The End, expanding on that theme and updating \nit in today's electronica style. But, it isn't boring ambient. It is complex, layered, \ninteresting and accesible all at the same time.\n\nAwesome Torrent for Doors lovers. My favorite is The Doors Myth and Reality when Ray talks about Jim. This is truly a nice compilation and please enjoy and Seed!
