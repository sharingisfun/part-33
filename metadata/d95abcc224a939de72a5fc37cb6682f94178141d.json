Total artistic commitment from Charles Dutoit and his inspired Montreal Symphony Orchestra served in digital sound in the extraordinary acoustics of St-Eustache Church, where it was recorded in 1986. This album has won the highest praise and continues to give me a special pleasure. Holst's portrait of the planets shines as bright as ever.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95abcc224a939de72a5fc37cb6682f94178141d","amp;dn":"Holst+-+The+Planets+-+Charles+Dutoit+++%28VBR+-+V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d95abcc224a939de72a5fc37cb6682f94178141d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,90,188,194,36,169,57,222,114,165,252,55,203,102,130,249,65,120,20,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
