You will have to select it yourself from\nwithin your player. It has been superficially proofread and only the\ncorrection wipable-&gt;wipeable was made. Look on opensubtitles.org (or\nsimilar) for your language. Make sure you get a 23.976 FPS version\notherwise you'll have sync problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b9def0f5c466fe709cefefed723d771c753ec1","amp;dn":"Tarkovsky+The+Mirror+%28Zirkalo%29+1975+Blu-Ray+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7b9def0f5c466fe709cefefed723d771c753ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,185,222,240,245,196,102,254,112,156,239,239,237,114,61,119,28,117,62,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
