Collected here to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Poe's birth are sixteen of his best tales accompanied by twenty essays from beloved authors, including T. Jefferson Parker, Lawrence Block, Sara Paretsky, and Joseph Wambaugh, among others, on how Poe has changed their life and work.\n\nMichael Connelly recounts the inspiration he drew from Poe's poetry while researching one of his books. Stephen King reflects on Poe's insight into humanity's dark side in &quot;The Genius of 'The Tell-Tale Heart.'&quot; \n\nJan Burke recalls her childhood terror during late-night reading sessions. Tess Gerritsen, Nelson DeMille, and others remember the classic B-movie adaptations of Poe's tales. in &quot;The Thief,&quot; Laurie R. King complains about how Poe stole all the good ideas . . . or maybe he just thought of them first.\n\nPowerful and timeless, In the Shadow of the Master is a celebration of one of the greatest literary minds of all time.\n\nGenre: Fiction&gt; Horror","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc0976ade9760f9994f3a58be70905b4cd73230","amp;dn":"In+the+Shadow+of+the+Master+Ed.+by+Michael+Connelly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc0976ade9760f9994f3a58be70905b4cd73230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,192,151,106,222,151,96,249,153,79,58,88,190,112,144,91,76,215,50,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
