Now he's obsessed with his heavy-metal superstar idol, Sammi Curr, who is killed in a hotel fire. Eddie becomes the recipient of the only copy of Curr's unreleased album, which when played backwards sends a message of destruction and as Halloween approaches, Eddie begins to realize this isn't only rock 'n roll... it's life and death and he must draw the line to thwart this mission. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d16153ae8eaf25a589e5c4fd654b5c196de9ee","amp;dn":"Trick+Or+Treat+%5B1986%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d16153ae8eaf25a589e5c4fd654b5c196de9ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,209,97,83,174,142,175,37,165,137,229,196,253,101,75,92,25,109,233,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
