The position of the directional pad can be adjusted freely, enabling players to switch between one-handed and two-handed play with a tap of the screen. The combat system has also been reworked, allowing for one-tap battles as well as more complex play.\r\n\r\nâ€“ The Tension System\r\nDuring battle, you can select 'Psyche Up' to give your next attack some extra oomph! The more you psyche a character up, the higher their tension will rise, until they finally reach an insane state known as super-high tension!\r\n\r\nâ€“ Skill Points\r\nSkill points are earned when your characters level up, and can be assigned to various skills in order to learn new spells and abilities. This system allows you to perfectly tailor your team to your liking.\r\n\r\nâ€“ Monster Teams\r\nCertain monsters found in the field can be scouted for your monster team â€“ if you're tough enough to beat them, that is! Once assembled, your crack squad can take part in the fiercely-contested tournaments held at the monster arena, and can even come to your aid in battle!\r\n\r\nâ€“ The Alchemy Pot\r\nCombine existing items to create entirely new ones!
