(This package\nis fixed, updated and ready to play on all windows system\nincluding XP.) But for those who's still young and don't\nknow what this game is check these links:\n\n[url=http://www.frontier.co.uk/games/firstencounters/index.html]INFO[/url]\n\n[url=http://www.jades.org/ffefaq2.htm]FFE FAQ[/url]\n\nI went through alot to get this game. First I Searched\nthe web and found it on Ebay. Then I went through a week\nlong auction. When I finally won the auction I had to\ncreate an account on PayPal because the owner wont accept\nother payment. Then I had to wait three more painful days\nbefore it finally arrived by mail.\n\nThis pack contains:\n\nFFE.rar   : The game files.\nDATA.rar  : This is the video files.\nReadMe.txt: This message.\n\nI have splitted the game into two parts incase you only\nwant the game. It will work without the video files but\nit might feel lonely in space so it's recomended. Besides,\nit's quite impressive what they could achieve back then.\n\nI have inserted some files to make it work on Windows without\nDos and Dosbox and found out that it also works on XP without\nDosbox. I also changed some sound FXs to more exciting ones.\nIf you want the old ones just check the FX folder and extract\nthe original over the new ones.\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. Extract &quot;FFE.rar&quot;.\n2. Execute &quot;ffewin28.exe&quot; to play.\n\nTo use the video files extrct &quot;DATA.rar&quot; into &quot;FIRSTENC&quot;\nfolder. Then turn it on via the in-game configuration.\n\nFor those with impressive soundcards (not the motherboard\ninbuild) might need to edit the file &quot;ffewin.cfg&quot; under\n[SOUND] parameter, to make the mid music use your soundcards\nsound library. Just change the 1 to 0 or something. I'm\nnot sure how but I got it to work on mine.\n\nThat's it!\n\nHappy space warping.\n\n/Frezzno\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:204022b3ba0137d9c8d36154dcb1f186757ba01a","amp;dn":"Frontier+%3A+First+Encounter+%28the+third+game+of+the+Elite+series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"204022b3ba0137d9c8d36154dcb1f186757ba01a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,64,34,179,186,1,55,217,200,211,97,84,220,177,241,134,117,123,160,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
