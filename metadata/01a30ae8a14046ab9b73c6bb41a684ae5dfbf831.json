While on patrol for geth, the protagonist Commander \n\nShepard's ship, the Normandy, comes under attack by an unknown assailant. The ship suffers extensive damage, forcing the crew to \n\nevacuate in escape pods. Joker continues to pilot the ship, despite it suffering extensive damage and the rest of the crew \n\nevacuating. Shepard reaches Joker, and orders him to get off the ship. Joker insists he can save the ship even though that \n\nobviously wasn't the case. Shepard drags Joker out of his seat and into a pod, but before he can board himself, debris slices \n\nthrough his suit. He suffocates and dies. His body is seen drifting through space. Commander Shepard's body is retrieved by the \n\nShadow Broker, a secretive buyer of information, selling it to the highest bidder, who has been employed by The Collectors, an \n\nenigmatic and xenophobic alien race who serve as the game's primary antagonists. In the events of Mass Effect: Redemption, former \n\nsquadmate Liara T'Soni is employed by Cerberus, a pro-human group, to get the body for the organization, before it is delivered to \n\nthe Collectors. After this, Cerberus works to revive the Commander through a project known as &quot;Lazarus.&quot; Two years later in 2185, \n\nShepard is awakened aboard a Cerberus space station that is under attack, and aids Cerberus agents Miranda Lawson and Jacob Taylor \n\nin escaping. Shepard is taken to Cerberus' headquarters and granted an audience with the Illusive Man, who explains that Shepard \n\nwas &quot;upgraded&quot; and asks for the Commander's help in combating a new threat which has been abducting entire human colonies. Shepard \n\nand his team are dispatched to the recently attacked colony of Freedom's Progress in the Terminus Systems to investigate. There, \n\nthe group encounters Tali, one of Shepard's former squad members, and discovers that the mysterious insect-like Collectors were \n\nbehind the attack. Shepard reports this to the Illusive Man, who then reveals what Shepard's previous squad members are up to. \n\nAfter receiving command of the Normandy SR-2, Shepard decides to begin recruiting a new team to discover the Collectors' plan.\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements :\n=============================\n\n* Windows XP, Vista, or 7\n* 1.8GHz Core 2 Duo Intel or equivalent AMD CPU\n* 1 GB RAM (XP) or 2 GB RAM (Vista, Windows 7)\n* NVIDIA GeForce 6800 or better with 256 MB of video memory\n (7300, 8100, 8200, 8300, 8400, and 9300 are below minimum system requirements)\n* ATI X1600 Pro or better with 256 MB of video memory\n (HD3200, and HD4350 are below minimum system requirements)\n* Shader Model 3.0 required\n* 100% DirectX compatible sound card and drivers\n* DirectX August 2008\n\n\n\n                            OPTIONAL OFICIAL FIX NOW AVAILABLE\n \n\n      ( TESTED AND APPROVED FOR 1 USER WITH THE PRESIDIUM LOADING PROBLEM )\n \n\nOFICIAL FIX FOR LOADING PROBLEMS INSIDE THIS FILE NOW AVAILABLE (385 MB IN 2 RAR PARTS) ...
