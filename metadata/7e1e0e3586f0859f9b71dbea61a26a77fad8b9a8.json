Citing Serge Gainsbourg as a major influence, the band combines cabaret-style vocals with a moody, intense brand of orchestral pop/rock. Lightburn's vision for the band is to create music out of real emotions, often giving his performances the feel of a musical therapy session. Given the level of intensity that this vision can require, it's not surprising that the Dears have endured numerous member defections, including a guitarist, drummer, and two bass players. The Dears released their debut CD, End of a Hollywood Bedtime Story, on Grenadine Records in 2000. In early 2001, the band entered the studio to record the follow-up, tentatively titled DeuxiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me Partie, and in 2004, the critically acclaimed full-length No Cities Left was released. Lightburn and longtime Dears keyboardist Natalia Yanchak were married the following year, and in 2006 the band released the stripped-down Gang of Losers. Missiles arrived in 2008, followed by the group's fifth studio album, Degeneration Street, in 2011. \n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:                  Indie\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n01.Omega Dog\n02.5 Chords\n03.Blood\n04.Thrones\n05.Lamentation\n06.Torches\n07.Galactic Tides\n08.Yesteryear\n09.Stick w/Me Kid\n10.Tiny Man\n11.Easy Suffering\n12.Unsung\n13.1854\n14.Degeneration Street\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e1e0e3586f0859f9b71dbea61a26a77fad8b9a8","amp;dn":"%5BIndie%5D+The+Dears+-+Degeneration+Street+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e1e0e3586f0859f9b71dbea61a26a77fad8b9a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,30,14,53,134,240,133,159,155,113,219,234,97,162,106,119,250,216,185,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
