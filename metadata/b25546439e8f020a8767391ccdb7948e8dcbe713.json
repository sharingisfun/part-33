Juliet has long forgotten the murder of her family or her identity, and cross dresses as Odin and the town's hero of justice, &quot;Red Whirlwind&quot;. A sudden escape in her daily escapades leads her to meet Romeo Candorebanto Montague, the kind son of the tyrannical Montague. Destiny has been set as these two individuals soon to be &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot; are cruelly toyed with by fate in the midst of war.
