The hour-long tv show documents their meeting at this year's GDC. Topics talked about include views on game design, responsibilities, improving the medium etc.\n\nThis was ripped from the high quality WMV stream from Arte's Plus 7 homepage. Please don't hate on me if you regard using WMV as &quot;selling out&quot;. Also, please forgive my shitty upload speed. And remember to seed this.\n\nAnother version of this episode (DVB-T recording, converted to x.264+AAC MP4) can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4985472\n\n\n\n\nAlso: Thanks for choosing Pixeljunk Eden as the prime example of Indie Game Extravaganza out of all the IGF games available.
