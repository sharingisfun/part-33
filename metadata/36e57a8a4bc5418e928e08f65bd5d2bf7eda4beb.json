It considers objects from the world around us, identifying and exploring the scientific concepts upon which they're based. Because it starts with objects and looks within them for science, it is the reverse of a traditional physics class. Instead of the usual principle-driven physics class, How Things Work is case-study physics. In this pilot semester of How Things Work, we will explore the basic laws of motion in the context of six familiar objects or activities: (1) Skating, (2) Falling Balls, (3) Ramps, (4) Seesaws, (5) Wheels, and (6) Bumper Cars. Despite their simplicity, these topics will bring us in contact with some of the most important concepts in physics, including inertia, energy, and momentum.\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/howthingswork1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e57a8a4bc5418e928e08f65bd5d2bf7eda4beb","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+How+Things+Work+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e57a8a4bc5418e928e08f65bd5d2bf7eda4beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,229,122,138,75,197,65,142,146,142,8,246,91,213,210,191,126,218,75,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
