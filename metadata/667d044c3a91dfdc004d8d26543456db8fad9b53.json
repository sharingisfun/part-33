All releases are made from the first generation master tape and mastered at half-speed, allowing for the finest sound quality possible. In the past, MFSL has produced cassette tapes, LPs, CDs, and even VHS releases of a few titles. In addition, each title is licensed to be mastered, manufactured, and sold within a specific time frame, and because of the limited quantities produced, the releases are highly sought after by collectors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:667d044c3a91dfdc004d8d26543456db8fad9b53","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Atom+Heart+Mother+%28MFSL%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"667d044c3a91dfdc004d8d26543456db8fad9b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,125,4,76,58,145,223,220,0,77,141,38,84,52,86,219,143,173,155,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
