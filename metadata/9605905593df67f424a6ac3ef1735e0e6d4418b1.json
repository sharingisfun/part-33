Plants need CO2 to make Oxygen. The more CO2 there is in the air, the bigger the plants grow and the more O2 they make which makes everything breathing air healthier. Duhhhhh It is called Photosynthesis, it is 4 grade science. Will they quit putting CO2 in Soda Drinks to save the Planet??? NO\n\nDescription:\n\nFox News - The Green Swindle, How Environmentalism Turned Into Fear-Mongering:\nNow liberals have told us for years that if we don't adopt their policies and give them more control over our lives, environmental Armageddon will be just around the bend. Now they say science is on their side and there's nothing left to debate.\n\nTonight we will expose some glaring errors in this so-called science and show you how scientists, politicians and big business have turned global warming hysteria into a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nBut first how environmentalism turned into fear-mongering over the climate. And we start at the beginning of The Green Swindle.\n\nRead more: http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/transcript/green-swindle-how-environmentalism-turned-fear-mongering#ixzz1taBj6epa\n\n\nChurch of Global Warming:\nA comprehensive review of the science, politics and economics of Global Warming, as Patrice Lewis contends theory can only be believed on faith, not facts.  These guys apparently werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hamstrung by the Scientific Method, which has the audacity to suggest that the process of establishing a theory (such as global warming) be Ã¢â‚¬Å“objective to reduce biased interpretations of the results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists, thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them. This practice, called Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfull disclosure,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nUnencumbered by such quaint scientific protocol, these guys knew the raw data they obtained were an inconvenient truth, so they Ã¢â‚¬Å“lostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ them. These Ã¢â‚¬Å“scientistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were determined to prove global warming by faith alone, not by any credible methodology or empirical evidence.\n\n\nShorts\nSigns of the Times\nSIN-ister Clips\nThe Holy Spirit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9605905593df67f424a6ac3ef1735e0e6d4418b1","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+SIN-ister+Secrets+-+68+-+The+Green+Swindle+%26amp%3B+The+Chu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9605905593df67f424a6ac3ef1735e0e6d4418b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,5,144,85,147,223,103,244,36,166,172,62,241,115,94,14,109,68,24,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
