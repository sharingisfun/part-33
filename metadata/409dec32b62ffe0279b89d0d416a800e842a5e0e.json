I had no idea what Watkins Glen was, and i hadn't heard many of the songs that were on this album. After taking the album home I read the cd booklet and found that Watkins Glen was a concert organized by Bill Graham which included The Allman Brothers Band, The Band, and the Grateful Dead.\r\n\r\nI am a HUGE fan of the Allmans and an even bigger fan of the dead. So, without even listening to this album i was excited. Listening to the album was no dissapointment to my anticipation either. The entire album is great. It blends all different types of music and occasional jams. The best songs in my opinion are ENDLESS HIGHWAY, THE RUMOR, and UP ON CRIPPLE CREEK. All of which were written by J.R. Robertson. All in all, i would have to say this is one of the better live albums that i have ever listened to.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Back To Memphis\r\n02 - Endless Highway\r\n03 - I Shall Be Released\r\n04 - Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\r\n05 - Too Wet To Work\r\n06 - Don't Ya Tell Henry\r\n07 - The Rumor\r\n08 - Time To Kill\r\n09 - Jam\r\n10 - Up On Cripple Creek\r\n\r\n*1995 Capitol Records | CDP 7243 8 31742 2 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Dylan - In Concert - Brandeis University 1963 (2011) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8947073/Bob_Dylan_-_In_Concert_-_Brandeis_University_1963_%282011%29__%5BEAC-F\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Dylan &amp; The Grateful Dead - Dylan &amp; The Dead (1987):\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8958547/Bob_Dylan__amp__The_Grateful_Dead_-_Dylan__amp__The_Dead_%281987%29_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Dylan &amp; Joan Baez - Voices Of A Generation [2CD] (2013) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/12313367/_Bob_Dylan__amp__Joan_Baez_-_Voices_Of_A_Generation_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-F\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Dylan - Self Portrait (1970) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9998430/Bob_Dylan_-_Self_Portrait_%281970%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Dylan - The Bootleg Series,Vol. 10.Another Self Portrait(1969-1971)[2CD](2013):\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9991979/Bob_Dylan_-_Bootleg_Series_Vol.10._Another_Self_Portrait_%5B2CD%5D_%28","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:409dec32b62ffe0279b89d0d416a800e842a5e0e","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+Live+At+Watkins+Glen+1973+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"409dec32b62ffe0279b89d0d416a800e842a5e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,157,236,50,182,47,254,2,121,184,157,13,65,106,128,14,132,42,94,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
