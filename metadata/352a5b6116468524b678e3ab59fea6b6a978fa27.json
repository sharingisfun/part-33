Nelson, aspiring hip-hop producer who loves soul samples and artistic statements.  Most likely the next Madlib/Dilla/9th Wonder, etc. etc.\n\nA quote from the man himself:\n\n&quot;Yo If I Made Beats for Money I would Be Just Like All these other Rap Cats trying to make a Buck! I Do It For the Love Of Music! I Dont think You Understand! I Love Money, I Love this Music, but at this Point in my Life the Two Dont NEED to Correlate! I hope I didnt go OVER your Head!\n\nPlus the Game aint ready for Artistic Minds....Right Now its about Blunts, Bitches, Guns, and More Material Shit that loses its value in time. Fuck Getting Rich with Money. I wanna Be rich with LOVE! If I Hear another nigga talking about what kinda weed they smoke or how much pussy they get, Im Gonna kill myself!&quot;\n\n\nReal talk.  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352a5b6116468524b678e3ab59fea6b6a978fa27","amp;dn":"Ill+Melodies+Instrumentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352a5b6116468524b678e3ab59fea6b6a978fa27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,42,91,97,22,70,133,36,182,120,227,171,89,254,166,182,169,120,250,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
