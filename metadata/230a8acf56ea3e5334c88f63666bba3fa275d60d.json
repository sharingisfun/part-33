It was April 16th, 1988, on Ian MackayeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 26th birthday. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve remained friends ever since. During that time Operation Ivy toured in a 1969 Newport that was beat to hell. The 69 Newport had a giant box on the roof that my father had built to store our equipment in. Fugazi is one of the greatest and most powerful live bands I have ever seen. Blueprint was on the 1990 Repeater album and is one of my favorite tunes.\n \nWritten by Guy Picciotto\n \nTim Timebomb-Vocals, Guitar\nJohn Morrical-Piano\nKevin Bivona-Guitar, B3\nJesse Bivona-Drums\nJustin Bivona-Bass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230a8acf56ea3e5334c88f63666bba3fa275d60d","amp;dn":"Blueprint+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230a8acf56ea3e5334c88f63666bba3fa275d60d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,10,138,207,86,234,62,83,52,200,143,99,102,107,186,63,162,117,214,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
