Genesis Ch. 1, V. 32 (03:24)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConcept:\r\n\r\nThe album was intended to be based on the I, Robot stories written by Asimov,\r\nand Woolfson actually spoke with Asimov, who was enthusiastic about the idea.\r\nAs the rights already had been granted to a TV/movie company, the album's title\r\nwas altered slightly by removing the comma, and the theme and lyrics were made\r\nto be more generically about robots rather than specific to the Asimov universe.\r\n\r\nThe cover inlay read: &quot;I Robot... The story of the rise of the machine and the\r\ndecline of man, which paradoxically coincided with his discovery of the wheel...\r\nand a warning that his brief dominance of this planet will probably end, because\r\nman tried to create robot in his own image.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe title of the final track, &quot;Genesis Ch.1 v.32,&quot; follows this theme by implying a\r\ncontinuation to the story of Creation, since the first chapter of Genesis only has\r\n31 verses.\r\n\r\nThe album cover photo of the band members is of the criss-crossing escalator\r\ntubes in the circular Terminal 1 building of Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris.\r\nOver this is superimposed a painting of a robot with a stylized atom for a brain.\r\nThe original vinyl release had a gatefold-style cover; the inside spread had\r\nprinted the lyrics for the non-instrumental selections and a monochrome\r\nphotograph of Parsons himself.\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios, London, between\r\nDecember 1976 and March 1977","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd7d88b3402236f4c6c18c3db97716459c16d77","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Parsons+Project+-+I+Robot+-+1977+%28MP3-320%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd7d88b3402236f4c6c18c3db97716459c16d77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,215,216,139,52,2,35,111,76,108,24,195,219,151,113,100,89,193,109,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
