The unusual setting in a distinct real-life location apparently attracted some attention in the local press, and a sense of place was lovingly established via continual &quot;County&quot; and &quot;Robbies' Mild&quot; references, plus liberal use of the northwestern rhyming-slang pejorative &quot;bobbins&quot;.  Each episode centred on the doings of one or more of the Conroy family: Maureen (Beverley Callard) and husband Eddie (John McArdle), a cab driver and aspiring champion organist, were parents to Michael (Jason Done), lead singer of the scout-hut-conquering Sweater Girls; Karen (Jo-Anne Knowles), who returned home trailing an unsuitable Southern boyfriend; and the 15-year-old narrator, Jason (Dominic Monaghan), a worldly-wise youth embittered by his girlfriend's decision to dump him for a &quot;spoon&quot; of an Italian exchange student.  Also present was idiot brother-in-law Dave (Stefan Escreet), a besuited young professional and proud owner of a &quot;Ford Foccus&quot;.  Regular support, in various roles, was provided by Chris Pavlo and Emma Clarke; Lanigan and Poyser themselves also made appearances. \n\n\n\n\nStockport, So Good They Named It Once - S01 - E01 - Barbie\nStockport, So Good They Named It Once - S01 - E02 - The Agony And The Ecstasy\nStockport, So Good They Named It Once - S01 - E03 - Dib Dib Dib\nStockport, So Good They Named It Once - S01 - E04 - Lights\nStockport, So Good They Named It Once - S01 - E05 - Focus\nStockport, So Good They Named It Once - S01 - E06 - Organathon\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 00s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9c18b45f6a74227984df87bf1f2f811bb61eb19","amp;dn":"Stockport%2C+So+Good+They+Named+It+Once+-+Series+01+-+Audio+Comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9c18b45f6a74227984df87bf1f2f811bb61eb19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,193,139,69,246,167,66,39,152,77,248,123,241,242,248,17,187,97,235,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
