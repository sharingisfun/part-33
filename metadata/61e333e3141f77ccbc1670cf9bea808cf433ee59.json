Johannes Merveldt moves to work in the University of Technology's virology department under Professor Behringer. Johannes pals up with an Algerian in the same department, Farid Madani, who's working on the same project but from a different angle. What Farid doesn't know is that Johannes was approached earlier by the German secret service to report on Farid, who they suspect is a sleepersleeper terrorist. While hanging out, the two men soon get to know a waitress, Beate who's been recently bruised by some affair. Strain between this trio appears when Beate falls for Farid and Johannes gets jealous. She later has sex with Johannes, but the relationship doesn't lead anywhere. Later, Johannes is sidelined at work by Behringer, and, after Farid doesn't support him, Johannes betrays his friend to the secret service. When a terrorist bomb explodes in the city, Farid comes under suspicion from the authorities, leaving Johannes in a quandary about what to do vis-a-vis his spying assignment.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Schlaefer.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.34 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 38mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 935 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 1 733 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 352 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.000\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.280\n      Stream size : 1.20 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 136 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420886/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420886/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGerman audio; German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese vobsub (idx/sub)\n\nMy rip of the Goethe Institut DVD\n\nBenjamin Heisenberg - Schlaefer (2005)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e333e3141f77ccbc1670cf9bea808cf433ee59","amp;dn":"Benjamin+Heisenberg+-+Schlaefer+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e333e3141f77ccbc1670cf9bea808cf433ee59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,227,51,227,20,31,119,204,188,22,112,207,155,234,128,140,244,51,238,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
