After getting a solid lineup together, they quickly released a self-titled EP and started referring to themselves in the third person. It took the band a while to come up with a name as meaningful as Boxed Wine, but they believe it says everything it should. The groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influences are quite varied, but they generally love mixing pop structures with fuzzy bass and disco beats. Ultimately, their goal is to make music that anybody can enjoy and hopefully dance to.\n\nWhy youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re holding this:\n\nBoxed Wine is pleased to announce the release of this new EP, acting as a Ã¢â‚¬ËœsamplerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for their debut album coming out in a few months. The three songs chosen lean toward rock, pop, and dance vibes, respectively. Still, they hope youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll like all three and choose whatever fits well on your station.\n\nA bit of press:\n\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Sirius XMU-ready anthems that will no doubt have these dudes burning up the festival circuit by this time next year.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Modern American Weekly\n\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦jangly pop right out of the top drawer. If your band is going to play guitar driven music nowadays it has to be jangly and fun. This ticks both boxes and an element of indie fuzziness too. Clean vocals and a good chorus make it a catchy and potential festival favourite.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Blushing Panda\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦extremely likable power-pop with terrific melodies and interesting beats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sweet, fizzy, and as intoxicating as a 5-liter box of FranziaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best swill.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jim Testa (Jersey Beat)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395767dbf14a46ce4d146234457f35d455a2e778","amp;dn":"Boxed+Wine+-+%26quot%3BCheap%2C+Fun+EP%26quot%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395767dbf14a46ce4d146234457f35d455a2e778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,87,103,219,241,74,70,206,77,20,98,52,69,127,53,212,85,162,231,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
