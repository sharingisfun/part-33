When we allow God's Love to dwell in our hearts, His love is unconditional, has no expectations of receiving love back, it's one sided, it's freeing, other-centered and given as a gift.\n\nJoin Chuck and Nancy Missler in the executive briefi\u001fng room of The River Lodge, New Zealand.\nOur prayer is that this DVD will not only help to enhance your walk with the Lord and help to improve all your relationships, it will also help you to understand GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overall purpose for your life. In other words, why God called you in the \u001ffirst place.\n\nRuntime: Approx. 6 hours\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, to Bless all that Seed Long.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c84ccb5fe1f16459854e73ba7a9b948cc4e55b4e","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+The+Word+-+003+-+Chuck+Missler+-+Agape+Weekend+-+Nancy+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c84ccb5fe1f16459854e73ba7a9b948cc4e55b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,76,203,95,225,241,100,89,133,78,115,186,122,155,148,140,196,229,91,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
