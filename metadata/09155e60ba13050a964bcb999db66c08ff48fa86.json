After almost two years of hard training, they parachuted into Normandy on D-Day and, later, Operation Market Garden. They fought their way through Belgium, France, and Germany, survived overwhelming odds, liberated concentration camps, and drank a victory toast in April of 1945 at Hitler's hideout in the Alps.\n\n Here, revealed for the first time, are stories of war, sacrifice, and courage as seen by one of the most revered combat units in military history. In We Who Are Alive and Remain, twenty men who were there, and the families of three deceased others, recount the horrors and the victories, the bonds they made, the tears and blood they shed- and the brothers they lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09155e60ba13050a964bcb999db66c08ff48fa86","amp;dn":"We+Who+Are+Alive+and+Remain%3A+Untold+Stories+from+the+Band+of+Bro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09155e60ba13050a964bcb999db66c08ff48fa86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,21,94,96,186,19,5,10,150,75,203,153,157,182,108,8,255,72,250,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
