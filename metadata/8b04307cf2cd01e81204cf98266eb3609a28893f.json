A man has a chance to explore the city and the depths of his consciousness, while sleeping in cars.\n\n-----------------\n\nIan Crossland is a contemporary writer, actor, musician, poet, dancer and film maker.  Since graduating from Kent State University with a BA in Theatre, he has fully embraced the wacky and unpossible.\n\nFrom working at Ground Zero in New York City after September 11, 2001 to doing national commercials.  Sleeping on the city streets of Chicago to mansions in the Hollywood Hills.  His ideas and tastes for society have grown with the perspective.\n\nOne thing is for sure, we will have a space elevator in Mexico and satellite internet available for anyone, free of charge.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iancrossland.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iancrossland.net&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b04307cf2cd01e81204cf98266eb3609a28893f","amp;dn":"Writing+In+The+Dark+-+Original+Manuscript","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b04307cf2cd01e81204cf98266eb3609a28893f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,4,48,124,242,205,1,232,18,4,207,152,38,110,179,96,154,40,137,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
