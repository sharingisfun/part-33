In addition to being a practicing witch, sheâ€™s also an operative for Vigilant Lock, an off-the-books program created to battle occult threatsâ€”by any means necessary. Despite her dedication to fighting the monsters threatening society, Harmony has become deeply conflicted about her job. Her last investigation resulted in a pile of dead bodies, and she suspects the wrong people are being punished for it. \r\nWhile on a much-needed vacation, Harmony gets pulled back into action. This time, though, sheâ€™s gone from solo work to being part of a team. Their target: the Bogeyman, a vicious and elusive figureâ€¦and the creature that destroyed Harmonyâ€™s childhood. \r\nSurrounded by quirky, fascinating characters as dedicated to one another as they are to their new partner, Harmony must learn to trust her teamâ€”and a new romantic interestâ€”on a dangerous and deadly mission that conjures up memories sheâ€™d much rather forget","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99c3d94dc3a3f97f03c3b4f290a876f8f8ac34b5","amp;dn":"Harmony+Black+-+Craig+Schaefer+%28epub+%26amp%3B+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99c3d94dc3a3f97f03c3b4f290a876f8f8ac34b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,195,217,77,195,163,249,127,3,195,180,242,144,168,118,248,248,172,52,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
