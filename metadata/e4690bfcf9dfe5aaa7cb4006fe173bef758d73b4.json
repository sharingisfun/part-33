The presentation is relatively non-technical to appeal to a broad spectrum of students and researchers.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Understanding Complex Systems\nPaperback: 378 pages\nPublisher: Springer; Softcover reprint of hardcover 1st ed. 2006 edition (November 25, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3642069150\nISBN-13: 978-3642069154\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4690bfcf9dfe5aaa7cb4006fe173bef758d73b4","amp;dn":"Life%3A+An+Introduction+to+Complex+Systems+Biology+%28Understanding+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4690bfcf9dfe5aaa7cb4006fe173bef758d73b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,105,11,252,249,223,229,170,167,203,64,6,254,23,59,239,117,141,115,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
