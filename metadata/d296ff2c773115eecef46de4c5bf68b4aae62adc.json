After being fired for insubordination, Adam uses the company's credit card to pay for bottle service for his friends at a club. Adam is later confronted by Wyatt's enforcer, Miles Meechum (Julian McMahon), who blackmails Adam into becoming a corporate spy for Wyatt by threatening to have him arrested for fraud.\n\nAdam is trained by Judith Bolton (Embeth Davidtz) and infiltrates a company run by Wyatt's former mentor, Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford), who stole several of Wyatt's ideas, by providing Goddard with an advanced software able to hack into cellphones, with potential military applications. FBI Agent Gamble (Josh Holloway) interrogates Adam, revealing that three other employees of Wyatt who transferred to Goddard's company were found dead, but Adam ignores him.\n\nAdam finds out Emma Jennings (Amber Heard), a woman he met during the party, is the Director of Marketing of Goddard's company and seduces her in order to steal files about Goddard's upcoming projects and give them to Wyatt, who threatens to kill Adam's father, Frank Cassidy (Richard Dreyfuss), if Adam doesn't steal a revolutionary prototype cellphone developed by Goddard. Adam later finds out Meechum and Bolton are monitoring him, and destroys the cameras in his apartment. In retaliation, Meechum runs over and nearly kills Adam's friend, Kevin (Lucas Till), and gives Adam 48 hours to steal the prototype.\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d296ff2c773115eecef46de4c5bf68b4aae62adc","amp;dn":"Paranoia+TSCam.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d296ff2c773115eecef46de4c5bf68b4aae62adc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,150,255,44,119,49,21,238,206,244,109,228,197,191,104,180,170,230,42,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
