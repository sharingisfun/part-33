Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu\n\nFor those interested in the GPU path to parallel enlightenment,\nthis new book from David Kirk and Wen-mei Hwu is a godsend, as it introduces\nCUDA, a C-like data parallel language, and Tesla, the architecture\nof the current generation of NVIDIA GPUs. In addition to explaining the\nlanguage and the architecture, they define the nature of data parallel problems\nthat run well on heterogeneous CPU-GPU hardware. More concretely,\ntwo detailed case studies demonstrate speedups over CPU-only C\nprograms of 10X to 15X for naÃ„Â±Ã‚Â¨ve CUDA code and 45X to 105X for expertly\ntuned versions. They conclude with a glimpse of the future by describing the\nnext generation of data parallel languages and architectures: OpenCL and\nthe NVIDIA Fermi GPU. This book is a valuable addition to the recently\nreinvigorated parallel computing literature.\n\nPublished by Morgan Kaufman, an imprint of El$evier\n\nRIP library dot nu, RIP ifile dot it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a255937677244699b390d86133f4649c78f7e8f0","amp;dn":"Programming+Massively+Parallel+Processors+by+Kirk+and+Hwu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a255937677244699b390d86133f4649c78f7e8f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,85,147,118,119,36,70,153,179,144,216,97,51,244,100,156,120,247,232,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
