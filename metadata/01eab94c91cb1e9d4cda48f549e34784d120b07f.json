She has a flourishing design career, an office overlooking the bay, a killer zucchini bread recipe, and no O. She has Clive (the best cat ever), great friends, a great rack, and no O.\n\nAdding insult to O-less, since her move, she has an oversexed neighbor with the loudest late-night wallbanging sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever heard. Each moan, spank, andÃ¢â‚¬â€œwas that a meow?Ã¢â‚¬â€œpunctuates the fact that not only is she losing sleep, she still has, yep, you guessed it, no O.\n\nEnter Simon Parker. (No, really, Simon, please enter.) When the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. Their late-night hallway encounter has, well, mixed results. Ahem. With walls this thin, the tensionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gonna be thickÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Unidentified Redhead\nWhen Grace Sheridan returns to Los Angeles to become a working actress, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a second shot at a life-long dream. With some help from her best-friend agent, will that dream become a realityÃ¢â‚¬â€or at thirty-three, has Grace missed her chance at the big time? And when an unexpected sizzling romance with Jack Hamilton, the entertainment industry's newest Ã¢â‚¬Å“itÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ boy, threatens to shine an uncomfortable spotlight on her life, how will that affect her careerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and his?\n\nFunny, borderline neurotic Grace is perfect in her imperfections, and the sexual chemistry between her and charming yet blissfully unaware Jack is off the charts. With laugh-out-loud dialogue and a super-steamy romance that will get your heart racing, sneaking around in L.A. and dodging the paparazzi has never been so fun.\n\nThe Redhead Revealed\n\nAs their careers catch fire, Grace and Jack -- everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite foul-mouthed, funny, and feisty couple -- find themselves on opposite coasts. Grace has landed in New York City, where she loves being onstage again, particularly because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s playing a fabulous character in a musical written by her old college flame, Michael. Their rekindled friendship makes exploring the city that much more fun.\n\nWait, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just friendship, right?\n\nMeanwhile, in L.A., Jack can scarcely keep up with the swirling throngs of women who track him everywhere he goes, the endless press appearances, and the ridiculous rules his manager, Holly, keeps concocting for him -- all part of the buildup to the release of Time, his steamy new film.\n\nThank goodness for phone sex.\n\nBut even when their schedules allow them to connect, Grace and Jack must keep their relationship off the radar and away from paparazzi cameras. Sure, the sex is sensational, but can this duo survive swirling rumors, the demands of their chosen professions, GraceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raging internal battles, and a whopping nine-year age difference?\n\nTick-tock, the clock is ticking. IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01eab94c91cb1e9d4cda48f549e34784d120b07f","amp;dn":"Alice+Clayton+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01eab94c91cb1e9d4cda48f549e34784d120b07f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,234,185,76,145,203,30,157,76,218,72,245,73,227,71,132,209,32,176,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
