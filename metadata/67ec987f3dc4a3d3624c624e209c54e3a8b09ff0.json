The project radiates with the love and legacy of the Grateful Dead, of which Bleeker has shown to be a devout fan. Despite the unmistakable influence of the aforementioned rock legends, Country Agenda is seasoned well enough to stand on its own. The album is full of adroitly crafted songs fleshed out with delicate organs, vocal harmonies, and twinkling keyboard touches.\r\nCountry Agenda is the follow-up to 2013â€™s How Far Away, and itâ€™s said to the first Freaks album to have been created collaboratively. According to a press release, â€œThe songs wander in slow motion like a coastline drive, drawing on the same wizened energy and brilliant restraint as Crazy Horse, the Dead, Moby Grape and other likeÂ­-minded cosmic travelers.â€\r\nCountry Agenda is the culmination of Bleekerâ€™s song writing, as well as the gelling together of a fully formed band. With the fullÂ­-time inclusion of guitarist Alex Steinberg, bassist Nick Lenchner, drummer Dylan Shumaker and keyboardist Jacob Wolf, along with occasional guest vocals from Mountain Man singer Molly Sarle, The Freaksâ€™ vibe has coalesced considerably.\r\nRating 9.0/10\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1 - Little Dream I Had.flac\r\n2 - California.flac\r\n3 - Country Agenda.flac\r\n4 - Portrait.flac\r\n5 - Downright Stinson.flac\r\n6 - The Rest.flac\r\n7 - Sealong Hair.flac\r\n8 - Honey, I Don't Know.flac\r\n9 - The Wind.flac\r\n10 - Turtle Dove.flac\r\n11 - U.H.M..flac\r\n12 - They've Gone Home.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~714-902 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67ec987f3dc4a3d3624c624e209c54e3a8b09ff0","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Alex+Bleeker+and+the+Freaks+-+Country+Agenda+%5BFLAC%2CTracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67ec987f3dc4a3d3624c624e209c54e3a8b09ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,236,152,127,61,196,163,211,98,76,98,78,32,156,84,227,168,176,159,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
