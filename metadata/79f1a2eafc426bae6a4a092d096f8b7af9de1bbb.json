The most reiterated command in the Bible is for us to sing our praises to God.  As a matter of fact, music (in one form or another) is mentioned well over 1000 times in both the Old and New Testament.  So here's your chance to do just that with 29 additional releases, bringing the 2012 year-to-date count up from 288 to 317 titles.  This torrent contains some great ones too.  MercyMe's new single, Josh Wilson's newly released live album, the much anticipated Papa San project, Evan Craft, Dave And Dill have a nice little hymns release, and even Planetshakers adds to their massive discography with &quot;Heal Our Land.&quot;\n\nThe 29 titles in this 11th bundle includes...\n\n * Andrea Thomas - 2012 - Awaken My Soul\n * Anita Wilson - 2012 - Worship Soul\n * Brutha War - 2012 - 4 The Sick\n * Carson Parks - 2012 - All You Gotta Do Is Love\n * Chase Callahn - 2012 - Something New EP\n * Dave And Dill - 2012 - Hymns From The Backseat\n * Desperation Band - 2012 - Center Of It All\n * Evan Craft - 2012 - Giants\n * Falling Up - 2012 - Mnemos\n * GS - 2012 - Warning Before Destruction Vol 3\n * Home Is Calling - 2012 - Evening Lights\n * Invisible Empires - 2012 - Acoustic EP\n * Josh Wilson - 2012 - Live From The Carson Center\n * K Thomas - 2012 - Pressure\n * Kelly Burton - 2012 - What About One EP\n * Lights - 2012 - Siberia Remixed\n * MercyMe - 2012 - The Hurt And The Healer - Single\n * Obb, The - 2012 - Live, Life, Loving EP\n * Papa San - 2012 - My Story\n * Phao - 2012 - Something Cold EP\n * Pioneer - 2012 - Pioneer\n * Planetshakers - 2012 - Heal Our Land - Deluxe Edition\n * Satellite - 2012 - Satellite\n * Mark Tiddy - 2012 - Escape This Town\n * Sounds Of Salvation - 2012 - Nuking The Fridge\n * Tidewater - 2012 - The Beautiful Life\n * Travis Ryan - 2012 - Fearless - Deluxe Edition\n * Warriors, The - 2012 - Above The Noise\n * Willet - 2012 - Love On The Outside EP\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - April 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f1a2eafc426bae6a4a092d096f8b7af9de1bbb","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+12+of+12%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f1a2eafc426bae6a4a092d096f8b7af9de1bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,241,162,234,252,66,107,174,106,74,9,45,9,111,139,122,249,222,27,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
