His father, Richard Bellero Sr., believes the scientist isn't strong enough to take over the Bellero business empire. In the meantime, Richard's wife Judith has more than enough ambition for the two of them. Richard, through a freak accident, reels in a being from another dimension with his laser experiment. The being has a small device that can project a shield that no force can penetrate. The alien at first wants to learn all about earth that he can and Richard cooperates. Judith, however, sees the alien and the shield-projecting device, as a means to power. While Richard is away, Judith first tricks the alien to deactivating his shield device then shoots the alien to prevent him from departing Earth. She removes the hand held device while failing to notice it was connected to a vein in the alien -- whose bodily fluid is the key to operating the device.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dde0b6470203d7c72b6fabcfd7079e601f06126b","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+-+The+Bellero+Shield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dde0b6470203d7c72b6fabcfd7079e601f06126b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,224,182,71,2,3,215,199,43,111,171,207,215,7,158,96,31,6,18,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
