So I thought, maybe I should just ISO it and put it out there on the interwebs for those who have the printer but have lost their disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6031f6847eb621c4dc0847233a2f6913114d458b","amp;dn":"Epson+POS+Thermal+Printer+TM-T20+Version+2.0+Disc+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6031f6847eb621c4dc0847233a2f6913114d458b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,49,246,132,126,182,33,196,220,8,71,35,58,47,105,19,17,77,69,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
