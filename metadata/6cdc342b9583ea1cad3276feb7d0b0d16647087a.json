Modifications: volume has been increased, EQd and slightly compressed. Ogre was singing through a megaphone on Psychoreal &amp; Shhh which is why the vocals sound the way they do for those songs.

That stopped after a few songs.\n\nVideo Info: Sony Cybershot Model DSC-W290 (Digital Still Camera) 12.1 Megapixels. 720p Hi-Def.
