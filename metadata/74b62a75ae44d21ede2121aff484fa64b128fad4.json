She learned at a young age\nnot to trust anyone. Especially not your spouse.\nSo she's planned. She's planned every detail\nof her life: who her husband will be, what their\ncareers will be, what their lives will be like.\nAll to avoid the pain of infidelity.\n\nDallas Brown lives according to his own terms.\nHe doesn't do relationships, he doesn't care\nwhat anyone thinks of him, and he doesn't live\nup to anyone's expectations.\n\nWhen Carmyn's fiancÃƒÂ© cheats on her, it sends\nher into a whirlwind of one-night stands with\nthe most infamous player on campus. She can't\nseem to stay away from this tough guy and his\ndangerous motorcycle. Everything about him is\nthe complete opposite of who she'd planned to\nfall in love with: tattoos, dark stubble along his\njawline, and hair that brushes his shoulders.\n\nAs Dallas and Carmyn begin to fall deeper and\ndeeper into each other, they learn that love can\ntruly be a wicked, wicked thing.\n\n\n\nWicked Thing\nBy Angeline Kace\nLanguage: EN\nPages: PDF 621 - EPUB 358","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b62a75ae44d21ede2121aff484fa64b128fad4","amp;dn":"Wicked+Thing+-+Angeline+Kace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b62a75ae44d21ede2121aff484fa64b128fad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,182,42,117,174,68,210,30,222,33,33,175,244,132,250,100,177,40,250,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
