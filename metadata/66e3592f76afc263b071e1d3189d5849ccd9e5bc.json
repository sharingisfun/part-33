The divers, realizing the momentousness of their discovery, began probing the mystery. Over the next six years, they became expert and well-traveled researchers, taught themselves German, hunted for clues in Germany, and constructed theories corrective of the history books, all in an effort to identify this sunken U-boat and its crew. During that time, three of their colleagues died exploring the wreck, including a father and son team. In 1997, when it all seemed in vain, the two divers came up with a final plan, so dangerous that the book ends with this last dive. \n\nIncluded is an interview with author, Robert Kurson, from C-SPAN Booknotes from July 11, 2004. \n\n\n=====================\nUploader's comments:\n\n- Uploaded because I thought it was a really well done and gripping tale, a great book, and very rare on the web. \n\n- The epub ebook is included as well \n\n- The PBS NOVA episode &quot;Hitler's Lost Sub&quot; was based on the submarine involved","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e3592f76afc263b071e1d3189d5849ccd9e5bc","amp;dn":"Shadow+Divers+-+Robert+Kurson+%5Bdiving+expeditions+to+a+WWII+sub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e3592f76afc263b071e1d3189d5849ccd9e5bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,227,89,47,118,175,194,99,176,113,225,211,24,157,88,73,204,217,229,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
