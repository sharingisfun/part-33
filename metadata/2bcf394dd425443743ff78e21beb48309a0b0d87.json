The delicate innuendos, coupled with Fry&amp;#039;s ability to suggest hidden meanings in everyday phrases, gave the impression that bubbling below the innocent surface were lewd undercurrents threatening to burst through, although they never did. To add to this mix, Hugh Laurie demonstrated his keyboard talents with parodies of musical genres.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bcf394dd425443743ff78e21beb48309a0b0d87","amp;dn":"A+Bit+of+Fry+and+Laurie+DVDRIP+-+S01E03+-+%5BDalif%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bcf394dd425443743ff78e21beb48309a0b0d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,207,57,77,212,37,68,55,67,255,120,226,27,235,72,48,154,11,13,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
