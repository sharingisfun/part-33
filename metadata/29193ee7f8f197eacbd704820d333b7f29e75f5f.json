In the late 90s, he traveled the world and found himself in Toronto, Canada, where he began a novel based on his own journals and road-trip experiences, written from his alter-egoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s point of view. The Matt Zander Journals is his first novel.\n\n\nShare and enjoy.\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nMatt Zander, under-achieving supermarket clerk, wakes in a downtown Toronto hospital after he was shot during a bungled robbery of his boss' luxurious home. As memory of his near-death experience begins to fade, he furiously scribbles down everything he remembers of his journey to the other side. Struggling with his purpose in life, Matt befriends a quiet young loner named Michael, whose dream is to leave the frozen winter landscape of Canada behind for the sun and glamour of Los Angeles. Together they set out cross-country, unaware the road trip will be the defining moment in both their lives.\n\n\nIncluded are eBook Formats: Mobipocket, Text, PDF, HTML, Sony Reader, Epub and Microsoft Reader.\nPublished: February 20, 2008\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1419684973\nISBN-13: 978-1419684975","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29193ee7f8f197eacbd704820d333b7f29e75f5f","amp;dn":"The+Matt+Zander+Journals+%28eBook+Editions%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29193ee7f8f197eacbd704820d333b7f29e75f5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,25,62,231,248,241,151,234,203,215,4,130,13,51,59,127,41,231,95,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
