Through interviews with family and colleagues of the brilliant theoretical physicist, as well as Hawking&amp;#039;s own synthesized readings and reminiscences, we learn of his early life, his struggle with the degenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and his wide-ranging contributions to our knowledge of time, black holes, and the origin of the universe. The science is never downplayed; between Hawking&amp;#039;s prose and Morris&amp;#039;s visual wizardry, important concepts such as entropy and singularities jump from the screen in memorable vignettes. (Hawking believes a truly universal theory of physics will be understood by &quot;scientists, philosophers, and just ordinary people.&quot;) Philip Glass&amp;#039;s music, subdued and minimal, balances the alternately somber and hilarious moods of the film. The viewer is left with a sense of awe at the joyous spirit of a man trapped in the world of the mind, occasionally letting the rest of us in on his discoveries.- From Amazon.com\n\n    \n   \n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1177 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 512x384\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English &amp; German\nSubtitles:German\nRunTime Per Part: 80 minutes\nPart Size: 896 (1/5th DVD)\nRipped by: Corax\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:159407bc39f0bf01871ede3bc5f4df735a8b6b28","amp;dn":"Stephen+Hawking+A+Brief+History+of+Time+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"159407bc39f0bf01871ede3bc5f4df735a8b6b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,148,7,188,57,240,191,1,135,30,222,59,197,244,223,115,90,139,107,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
