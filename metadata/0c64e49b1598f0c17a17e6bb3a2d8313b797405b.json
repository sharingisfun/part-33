Produced by Greg Leisz, the album's eleven majestic cuts represent the best of what country and folk are all about--gutsy and real, powerful and brave, no production tricks, just pure, suberbly-crafted music.\nA striking feature of BLACKJACK DAVID is its use of wide open spaces--each song stretches and breathes, and each story ebbs and swells within a wide dynamic range. The wistful &quot;Abilene&quot; uses harmonium swells and tremolo guitar (courtesy of Leisz, who dips into a wide sonic pallette throughout the album) to propel its nomadic narrative. &quot;Evening Blues,&quot; an elegant acoustic number, sticks to gentle, evocative fingerpicking and harmonics, fleshed out with accordion and gentle percussion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c64e49b1598f0c17a17e6bb3a2d8313b797405b","amp;dn":"Dave+Alvin+-+Blackjack+David+%5B1998%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c64e49b1598f0c17a17e6bb3a2d8313b797405b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,100,228,155,21,152,240,193,122,23,230,187,58,45,131,19,183,151,64,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
