But luckily he was back in 1967. That year his playing at the club during the summer was even more majestic and inspired than before, possibly because of the excellent rhythm section. I happened to be at the club this particular evening, and the concert stands out in my memory as one of the best I ever heard with Gordon. The recording doesn't contradict my memory, and this performance is a classic. Gordon plays marvelously through his 30 solo choruses, followed by Kenny Drew, Niels-Henning Ãƒâ€“rsted Pedersen and Albert Heath, respectively. The tempo is fast, and each man is up on his toes, making the music glow. It was certainly a hot night. NHÃƒâ€“P plays a 6-chorus solo where his articulation is unusually clean and precise, especially considering the tempo.\n\nTracklist\n\nA1 Sonnymoon For Two Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rollins 15:28\nA2 For All We Know Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Coots, Lewis 8:52\nB1 Devilette Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tucker 12:45\nB2 Doxy Written-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rollins 7:22\n\n\nA1 Like Someone In Love 12:38\nA2 Body And Soul 9:31\nB1 There Will Never Be Another You 12:29\nB2 Blues Walk 13:25\n\nCredits\n\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson\nDesign Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hamish &amp; Gustav\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath\nEngineer [Recording] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Birger Svan\nPhotography By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Redfern\nPiano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Drew\nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alan Bates\nTenor Saxophone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dexter Gordon\n\nNotes\n\nRecorded at the Montmartre Jazzhuis, Copenhagen, 20th July 1967.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ab4d076808f3d887585c114b207c194f25e289","amp;dn":"%7B24+96%7D+Dexter+Gordon-The+Montmartre+Collection+%7B2+LP%7D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ab4d076808f3d887585c114b207c194f25e289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,171,77,7,104,8,243,216,135,88,92,17,75,32,124,25,79,37,226,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
