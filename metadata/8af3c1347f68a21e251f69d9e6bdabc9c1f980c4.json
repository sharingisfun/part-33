I simply compiled everything together so that it is easy to install and update.\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nThe store content is a part of the mods included, so if you do not install the mods the content from the online store will be missing.\n\nI also added some mods of my own besides the store content. You can remove thoose you do not want to have installed.\n\nThe mods added:\n(store content)\nAI-fixes (alfixes.package)\nNo censur (NoMosaicWA.package)\nModern computer (M4RK13_MacBookPro_v1-01.package)\nModern phone (M4RK13_iPhone4HomeScreen.package) // Mabye broken :/\nNo intro videos (nointro.package)\n\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Install all games from 01 to 10\nNOTE: The Sims 3 Pets installation is not in .iso format, but instead .rar\nTo install simply extract the rar and run the Sims3EP05Setup.exe\n\n2. Use correct keygens or serials\n\n3. Launch S3Launcher.exe in your installation folder (As default located in; c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3\\Game\\bin)\n\n4. Update the game using the button in the launcher (1/29/2012 the newest was 1.29.55)\n\n5. Open the &quot;TS3 Crack 1.29.55 - TSV.rar&quot; and extract TSW3.exe and TSLHost.dll to your sims 3 installation (NOT THE EXPANSION!)\nAs default you should extract the two files to c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3\\Game\\bin\n\n\n6.(Optional) Move Mods.rar to &quot;My Documents\\Electronic Art\\The Sims3\\&quot; and extract the content here, \nso that there is now a folder inside called &quot;Mods&quot;. And inside that folder there should be 3 things; 2 folders (Overrides &amp; Packages) and 1 file (Resource.cfg)\n\nYou can add or remove mods from the mods\\package folder to customize your gameplay. I've already added a few of my favorites.\nTo uninstall mods, simply remove the file(s) from the packages folder.\n\nFor more information on mods: http://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:Installing_Package_Files \n\n\n7. Play!\n\n\nI found no virus or malicious software in any of the cracks/keygens or files. \n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af3c1347f68a21e251f69d9e6bdabc9c1f980c4","amp;dn":"The+Sims+3+-+ALL+EXPANSIONS+%2B+STORE+CONTENT+-+NEWEST+VERSION%28v1.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af3c1347f68a21e251f69d9e6bdabc9c1f980c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,243,193,52,127,104,162,30,37,31,105,217,230,189,171,201,193,249,128,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
