After years of honing her craft ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ performing at over 150 fairs and festivals in 47 states and across Europe, and working as a full-time staff songwriter on NashvilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Music Row ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nygaard has emerged as an award-winning singer-songwriter whose new album has swept the Americana, Roots, and Folk Charts (actually staying on the Folk Charts for three months now).\n\nProduced by Nygaard in 2011, Let The Storm Roll In provides an excellent showcase for her multiple talents and mastery of several styles. From quiet country/folk story-songs to old-time country rootsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦from upbeat love-and-heartache songs (delivered by self-described ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtorch singers in cowboy bootsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to social commentaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦from personal ballads to laugh-out-loud humor, Claudia is a consummate storyteller. And her rich, warm voice is well suited for all these styles. On every track, her lyrics are impeccably crafted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ witty or moving, catchy or thought-provoking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ perfectly attuned to whatever is called for. But it is far more than professional perfection that has made this CD garner critical accolades from reviewers and DJs alike. This album has heart.\n\nIn fact, Let The Storm Roll In holds some gems that have the makings of instant classics. Not surprisingly, they are often the ones with the most personal, authentic theme to them, mined from NygaardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own life. Among these are: J.C. and His Left Side. Coming straight out of NygaardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s childhood, J.C. is a look at racism in decades past from a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s innocent perspective. His Left Side is a beautiful tribute to her father in his final days and the spirit that overcomes mortal limitations.\n\nEqually powerful is the opening track, Big Country, an epic tribute to every family who has ever immigrated to America. The seemingly simple concept ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that people of all nationalities have come here to follow their personal dreams, and they have all struggled to make those dreams a reality ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is so profoundly moving and unifying, that the song is nothing short of inspiring. The lyrics recount traditional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of these immigrants, from the Irish (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe had names like Sean and Coleen when we reached the harborÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to Scandinavian, Hispanic, Jewish, Asian, Native American and Islamic, and they are accompanied by typical instrumentation from those countries. The Irish verse opens with a penny whistle and a bodhranÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦the Scandinavian verse has a fiddle behind itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and the Hispanic verse contains an accordion.\n\nFinally, my own personal favorite is the guaranteed-to-make-you-smile satire, Miss Kitty, a brilliant spoof of the old classic TV Western series, Gunsmoke. Its catchy chorus, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon Marshall, give Miss Kitty a kiss,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ pokes fun at the uptight mores of the 50s, when the show was conceived, hysterically viewing the prim-and-proper behavior through a modern lens.\n\nNot surprisingly, several of the songs on this album have already earned top honors. In 2004, Claudia won the coveted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNew FolkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ award at the Kerrville Folk Festival with J.C. and Georgia Boy, a sensuous, dreamy 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s style love song evoking the feeling of Ray CharlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ classic Georgia. In 2009, Claudia was chosen as one the Emerging Artists at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival in New York. And more recently, this fall, her epic, Big Country, was selected for the in-flight playlist of Lufthansa Airlines.\n\nNygaard does all her own back-up vocals, but she does sing one duet, I Want to Touch You, with Lennie Gallant, who has won 14 awards from the Canadian East Coast Music Association, including male artist of the year and album of the year.\n\nIn addition, Let The Storm Roll In boasts an impressive cast of musicians, including Colin Linden (of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings) on electric guitar, legendary session player Charlie McCoy on harmonica, Grammy winners Andy Reiss (on acoustic guitar) and Jeff Taylor (on penny whistle and accordion), multi-instrumentalist Fats Kaplan on fiddle, dobro, mandolin, and accordion; plus Telecaster wizard Redd Volkaert, dobro virtuoso Randy Khors, and Prairie Home Companion favorite Cindy Cashdollar on lap steel and dobro. The rhythm section is made up of Johnny Cash sideman Dave Roe on doghouse bass, and Rick Lonow on percussion.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a top-flight production from start to finish, and seasoned with wit, wisdom and humor, Let The Storm Roll In should earn Claudia Nygaard a spot in the limelight for a long time to come.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/05/claudia-nygaard/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/05/claudia-nygaard/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e9fc782f1d21c9fb75505b793b6f8dddd92967","amp;dn":"Claudia+Nygaard...Let+The+Storm+Roll+In%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e9fc782f1d21c9fb75505b793b6f8dddd92967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,233,252,120,47,29,33,201,251,117,80,91,121,59,111,141,221,217,41,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
