They gave us sophisticated road systems, chariots and the modern-day calendar. And of course they had to contend with barbarian hordes who continually threatened the peace, safety and prosperity of their Empire. Didn't they?\n\nTerry Jones' Barbarians takes a completely fresh approach to Roman history. Not only does it offer us the chance to see the Romans from a non-Roman perspective, it also reveals that most of the people written off by the Romans as uncivilized, savage and barbaric were in fact organized, motivated and intelligent groups of people, with no intentions of overthrowing Rome and plundering its Empire.\n\nThis is the story of Roman history as seen by the Britons, Gauls, Germans, Greeks, Persians and Africans. The Vandals didn't vandalize - the Romans did. The Goths \ndidn't sack Rome - the Romans did. Attila the Hun didn't go to Constantinople to destroy it, but because the Emperor's daughter wanted to marry him. And far from civilizing the societies they conquered the Romans often destroyed much of what they found.\n\nTerry Jones travels round the geography of the Roman Empire and through 700 years of history - bringing wit, irreverence, passion and the very latest scholarship to transform our view of the legacy of the Roman Empire and the creation of the modern world.\n\n             Welcome to history from a different point of view...\n\nEp 2. &quot;The Savage Goths&quot;\n\nFirst broadcast 2nd June 2006\n\nTVRip\nSize:  347MB\nLenght:00:58:40\nVideo: DIVX 640x464 25.00fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps [Stream 01]\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa13aa64f1397bf91fc815ac527f2a23e638272f","amp;dn":"Terry_Jones-Barbarians-02-The_Savage_Goths-TVRip-%28695kbps_XviD%29-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa13aa64f1397bf91fc815ac527f2a23e638272f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,19,170,100,241,57,123,249,31,200,21,172,82,127,42,35,230,56,39,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
