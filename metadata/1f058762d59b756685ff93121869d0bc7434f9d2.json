After getting downsized from the CIA, he takes any job he can to pay his debts and alimony. He isn't a bad guy by nature, but out of necessity. He has to live a life where things don't matter, and long as he gets paid. His motto, simply stated: 'Every man has his price.'\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f058762d59b756685ff93121869d0bc7434f9d2","amp;dn":"Whore+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f058762d59b756685ff93121869d0bc7434f9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,5,135,98,213,155,117,102,133,255,147,18,24,105,208,188,116,52,249,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
