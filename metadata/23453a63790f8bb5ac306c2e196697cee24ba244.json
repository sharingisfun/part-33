In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his broad shoulders. With the final battle joined and the legions of darkness gathering, Gandalf urgently tries to rally Gondor's broken army to action. \n\nHe is aided by Rohan's King Theoden, who unites his warriors for history's biggest test. \n\nYet even with their courage and passionate loyalty, the forces of men--with Eowyn and Merry hidden among them--are no match for the enemies swarming against Gondor. Still, in the face of great losses, they charge forward into the battle of their lifetimes, tied together by their singular goal to keep Sauron distracted and give the Ring Bearer a chance to complete his quest. \n\nTheir hopes rest with Frodo, a tiny but determined hobbit making a perilous trip across treacherous enemy lands to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. \n\nThe closer Frodo gets to his final destination, the heavier his burden becomes and the more he must rely on Samwise Gamgee. \n\nGollum--and the Ring itself--will test Frodo's allegiances and, ultimately, his humanity.\n\nStarring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://omifast-mainmovies.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://omifast-mainmovies.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23453a63790f8bb5ac306c2e196697cee24ba244","amp;dn":"Lord+of+The+Rings+3+-+DvDrip+Xvid+-+Omifast+Greek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23453a63790f8bb5ac306c2e196697cee24ba244","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,69,58,99,121,15,139,181,172,48,108,46,25,102,151,206,226,75,162,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
