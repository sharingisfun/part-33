I realize thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a weird thing for a seventh grader to say, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how good I had it until the day it was replaced by scratchy (sand)paper.\n \nGood toilet paper was the first thing to go. . . .\n \nYour friend,\n \nBenjamin Epstein\n \nBenjamin is about to lose a whole lot more than good toilet paper. But even with his flair for clever slogans, will he be able to win a cash prize large enough to keep a promise he made to his dad before he died?\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff3f3467a3cf88617e23d93b031a9803b0a90716","amp;dn":"Donna+Gephart+-+Death+by+Toilet+Paper+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff3f3467a3cf88617e23d93b031a9803b0a90716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,63,52,103,163,207,136,97,126,35,217,59,3,26,152,3,176,169,7,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
