Students will find it both readable and comprehensive. The fundamental ideas relevant to the understanding of the electrical properties of materials are emphasized; in addition, topics are selected in order to explain the operation of devices having applications (or possible future applications) in engineering. The mathematics, kept deliberately to a minimum, is well within the grasp of a second-year student. This is achieved by choosing the simplest model that can display the essential properties of a phenomenom, and then examining the difference between the ideal and the actual behaviour.\nThe whole text is designed as an undergraduate course. However most individual sections are self contained and can be used as background reading in graduate courses, and for interested persons who want to explore advances in microelectronics, lasers, nanotechnology, and several other topics that impinge on modern life.\n\nTo request a copy of the Solutions Manual, visit http://global.oup.com/uk/academic/physics/admin/solutions.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nThe European Conferences on Numerical Mathematics and Advanced Applications (ENUMATH) are a series of conferences held every two years to provide a forum for discussion of new trends in numerical mathematics and challenging scientific and industrial applications at the highest level of international expertise. ENUMATH 2011 was hosted by the University of Leicester (UK) from the 5th to 9th September 2011. This proceedings volume contains more than 90 papers by speakers of the conference and gives an overview of recent developments in scientific computing, numerical analysis, and practical use of modern numerical techniques and algorithms in various applications. New results on finite element methods, multiscale methods, numerical linear algebra, and finite difference schemes are presented. A range of applications include computational problems from fluid dynamics, materials, image processing, and molecular dynamics.Ã¢â‚¬â€¹","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed9f19196c8329828d27211e5001169453f6a0b","amp;dn":"%5BLaszlo+Solymar+%2C+Donald+Walsh+%2C+Richard+R.+A.+Syms%5DElectrical+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed9f19196c8329828d27211e5001169453f6a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,217,241,145,150,200,50,152,40,210,114,17,229,0,17,105,69,63,106,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
