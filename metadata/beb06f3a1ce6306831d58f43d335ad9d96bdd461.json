Ã¡Â¼ï¿½ÃŽÂ³Ãï¿½ÃŽÂ®ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ¿Ãï¿½ÃŽÂ¿ÃŽÂ¹, trans: egrÃ„â€œÃŒï¿½goroi; Slav transliteration, Grigori,[2] &quot;Watchers&quot;, &quot;those who are awake&quot;; Chaldean, &quot;guard&quot;, &quot;watcher&quot;[3]) is a term used in connection with biblical angels. Watcher occurs in both plural and singular forms in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC), where reference is made to their holiness. The apocryphal Books of Enoch (1st and 2nd centuries BC) refer to both good and bad Watchers, with a primary focus on the rebellious ones.\n\nDaniel\n\nIn the Book of Daniel 4:13, 17, 23[4] there are three references to the class of &quot;watcher, holy one&quot; (watcher, Aramaic `iyr; holy one, Aramaic qaddiysh). The term is introduced by Nebuchadnezzar who says he saw &quot;a watcher, a holy one come down (singular verb) from heaven.&quot; He describes how in his dream the watcher says that Nebuchadnezzar will eat grass and be mad and that this punishment is &quot;by the decree of the Watchers, the demand by the word of the Holy Ones&quot; - &quot;the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.&quot; After hearing the king's dream Daniel considers for an hour and then responds:\n\n&quot;And whereas the king saw a watcher, a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him; This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king.&quot;[5]\n\nLutheran Protestant reformer Johann Wigand viewed the watcher in Nebuchadnezzar's dream as either God himself, or the Son of God. He promoted Trinitarian thinking by linking verse 17 (&quot;This matter is by the decree of the watchers&quot;) with verse 24 (&quot;this is the decree of the most High&quot;).[6]\n\nSecular scholars view these &quot;watchers, holy ones&quot; as perhaps showing an influence of Babylonian religion, that is an attempt by the author of this section of Daniel to present Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian gods recognizing the power of the god of Israel as &quot;Most High.&quot;[7] The Greek Septuagint version differs from the Aramaic Massoretic Text: for example, the Aramaic text is ambiguous about who is telling the story of verse 14, whether it is Nebuchadnezzar himself, or the watcher in his dream.[8]\nBooks of Enoch\n\nIn the Books of Enoch, the first Book of Enoch devotes much of its attention to the fall of the Watchers. The Second Book of Enoch addresses the Watchers (Gk. egrÃ„â€œÃŒï¿½goroi) who are in fifth heaven where the fall took place. The Third Book of Enoch gives attention to the unfallen Watchers.[9]\n\nThe use of the term &quot;Watchers&quot; is common in the Book of Enoch. The Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 6-36) occurs in the Aramaic fragments with the phrase irin we-qadishin, &quot;Watchers and Holy Ones&quot;, a reference to Aramaic Daniel.[10] The Aramaic irin &quot;watchers&quot; is rendered as &quot;angel&quot; (Greek angelos, Coptic malah) in the Greek and Ethiopian translations, although the usual Aramaic term for angel malakha does not occur in Aramaic Enoch.[11] The dating of this section of 1 Enoch is around 2nd-1st Century BC. This book is based on one interpretation of the Sons of God passage in Genesis 6, according to which angels married with human females, giving rise to a race of hybrids known as the Nephilim. The term irin is primarily applied to disobedient Watchers who numbered a total of 200, and of whom their leaders are named, but equally Aramaic iri (&quot;watcher&quot; singular) is also applied to the obedient archangels who chain them, such as Raphael (1 Enoch 22:6).\nBook of Enoch\n\nIn the Book of Enoch, the Watchers (Aramaic. Ã—Â¢Ã–Â´Ã—â„¢Ã—Â¨Ã–Â´Ã—â„¢Ã—Å¸, iyrin), are angels dispatched to Earth to watch over the humans. They soon begin to lust for human women and, at the prodding of their leader Samyaza, defect en masse to illicitly instruct humanity and procreate among them. The offspring of these unions are the Nephilim, savage giants who pillage the earth and endanger humanity. Samyaza and his associates further taught their human charges arts and technologies such as weaponry, cosmetics, mirrors, sorcery, and other techniques that would otherwise be discovered gradually over time by humans, not foisted upon them all at once. Eventually God allows a Great Flood to rid the earth of the Nephilim, but first sends Uriel to warn Noah so as not to eradicate the human race. The Watchers are bound &quot;in the valleys of the Earth&quot; until Judgment Day. (Jude verse 6 says that these fallen angels are kept &quot;in everlasting chains under darkness&quot; until Judgement Day.)\n\nThe chiefs of tens, listed in the Book of Enoch, are as follows:\n\n  7. And these are the names of their leaders: SÃƒÂªmÃƒÂ®azÃƒÂ¢z, their leader, ArÃƒÂ¢kÃƒÂ®ba, RÃƒÂ¢mÃƒÂªÃƒÂªl, KÃƒÂ´kabÃƒÂ®ÃƒÂªl, TÃƒÂ¢mÃƒÂ®ÃƒÂªl, RÃƒÂ¢mÃƒÂ®ÃƒÂªl, DÃƒÂ¢nÃƒÂªl, ÃƒÅ zÃƒÂªqÃƒÂªÃƒÂªl, BarÃƒÂ¢qÃƒÂ®jÃƒÂ¢l, AsÃƒÂ¢ÃƒÂªl, ArmÃƒÂ¢rÃƒÂ´s, BatÃƒÂ¢rÃƒÂªl, AnÃƒÂ¢nÃƒÂªl, ZaqÃƒÂ®ÃƒÂªl, SamsÃƒÂ¢pÃƒÂªÃƒÂªl, SatarÃƒÂªl, TÃƒÂ»rÃƒÂªl, JÃƒÂ´mjÃƒÂ¢ÃƒÂªl, SariÃƒÂªl. 8. These are their chiefs of tens.\n  Ã¢â‚¬â€R. H. Charles translation, The Book of the Watchers, Chapter VI.\n\nThe book of Enoch also lists leaders of the 200 fallen angels who married and commenced in unnatural union with human women, and who taught forbidden knowledge. Some are also listed in Book of Raziel (Sefer Raziel HaMalakh), the Zohar, and Jubilees.\n\n  Araqiel (also Arakiel, Araqael, Araciel, Arqael, Sarquael, Arkiel, Arkas) taught humans the signs of the earth. However, in the Sibylline Oracles, Araqiel is referred to not as a fallen angel, or Watcher, but as one of the 5 angels who lead the souls of men to judgement, the other 4 being Ramiel, Uriel, Samiel, and Azazel.\n  Armaros (also Amaros) in Enoch I taught men the resolving of enchantments.\n  Azazel taught men to make knives, swords, shields, and how to devise ornaments and cosmetics.\n  Gadreel taught the art of cosmetics, the use of weapons and killing blows. It was he who led Eve astray in the garden of eden.[citation needed]\n  Baraqel (Baraqiel) taught men astrology\n  Bezaliel mentioned in Enoch I, left out of most translations because of damaged manuscripts and problematic transmission of the text.\n  Chazaqiel (sometimes Ezeqeel or Cambriel) taught men the signs of the clouds (meteorology).\n  Kokabiel (also Kakabel, Kochbiel, Kokbiel, Kabaiel, and Kochab), In the Book of Raziel he is a high-ranking, holy angel. In Enoch I, he is a fallen Watcher, resident of the nether realms, and commands 365,000 surrogate spirits to do his bidding. Among other duties, he instructs his fellows in astrology.\n  Penemue &quot;taught mankind the art of writing with ink and paper,&quot; and taught &quot;the children of men the bitter and the sweet and the secrets of wisdom.&quot; (I Enoch 69.8)\n  Sariel (also Suriel) taught mankind about the courses of the moon (at one time regarded as forbidden knowledge).\n  Samyaza (also Shemyazaz, Shamazya, Semiaza, Shemhazi, Semyaza and Amezyarak) is one of the leaders of the fall from heaven in Vocabulaire de l' Angelologie.\n  Shamsiel, once a guardian of Eden as stated in the Zohar, served as one of the two chief aides to the archangel Uriel (the other aide being Hasdiel) when Uriel bore his standard into battle, and is the head of 365 legions of angels and also crowns prayers, accompanying them to the 5th heaven. In Jubilees, he is referred to as one of the Watchers. He is a fallen angel who teaches the signs of the sun.\n  Yeqon (also Jeqon or Yaqum, Ã—â„¢Ã–Â¸Ã—Â§Ã—â€¢Ã–Â¼Ã—ï¿½, &quot;he shall rise&quot;) was the ringleader who first tempted the other Watchers into having sexual relations with humans. His accomplices were Asbeel, Gadreel, Penemue, and Kasdaye (or Kasadya). Together, they were known as the Five Satans.\n\nThe account of the Book of Enoch has been associated with the passage in Genesis 6:1-4, which speaks of Sons of God instead of Watchers:\n\n  When men began to multiply on earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw how beautiful the daughters of man were, and so they took for their wives as many of them as they chose. Then the Lord said: &quot;My spirit shall not remain in man forever, since he is but flesh. His days shall comprise one hundred and twenty years.&quot; At that time the Nephilim appeared on earth (as well as later), after the sons of God had intercourse with the daughters of man, who bore them sons. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown.\n\n\n\nFor other writings attributed to Enoch, see Book of Enoch (disambiguation).\n\nThe Book of Enoch (also 1 Enoch[1]; Ge'ez: Ã¡Ë†ËœÃ¡Å’Â½Ã¡Ë†ï¿½Ã¡ï¿½Ë† Ã¡Ë†â€žÃ¡Å â€“Ã¡Å Â­ mÃƒÂ¤ts'hafÃƒÂ¤ henok) is an ancient Jewish religious work, traditionally ascribed to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. It is not part of the biblical canon as used by Jews, apart from Beta Israel. It is regarded as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, but not by any other Christian group.\n\nThe older sections (mainly in the Book of the Watchers) are estimated to date from about 300 B.C., and the latest part (Book of Parables) probably was composed at the end of the first century B.C.[2]\n\nIt is wholly extant only in the Ge'ez language, with Aramaic fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls and a few Greek and Latin fragments. For this and other reasons, the traditional Ethiopian belief is that the original language of the work was Ge'ez, whereas non-Ethiopian scholars tend to assert that it was first written in either Aramaic or Hebrew; E. Isaac suggests that the Book of Enoch, like the Book of Daniel, was composed partially in Aramaic and partially in Hebrew.[3]:6 No Hebrew version is known to have survived.\n\nThe authors of the New Testament were familiar with the content of the story and influenced by it:[4] a short section of 1 Enoch (1 En 1:9) is quoted in the New Testament (Letter of Jude 1:14Ã¢â‚¬â€œ15), and is attributed there to &quot;Enoch the Seventh from Adam&quot; (1 En 60:8). The text was also utilised by the community that originally collected the Dead Sea Scrolls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb06f3a1ce6306831d58f43d335ad9d96bdd461","amp;dn":"B+I+B+L+E+-+L+I+E+S+-+Part+14+-+The+Real+Truth+-+U+F+O+s+-+Alien","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb06f3a1ce6306831d58f43d335ad9d96bdd461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,176,111,58,28,230,48,104,49,213,143,67,211,53,173,157,150,189,212,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
