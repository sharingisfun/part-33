It was released as the album's fourth single in 1996.\n\n   Musically, the song is a glossy take on a basic grunge music format with delicate, sparsely-instrumented verses alternating with loud, aggressive chorus sections. Lyrically, it comprises a series of vignettes describing situations that end with the question &quot;Isn't it ironic?&quot;\n\n    \n                                   ***Ironic.***\n\n\n                                      Enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f718086df82854e9e8f2252cd3ef1503a5a76f","amp;dn":"Alanis+Morissette-Ironic%281996%29%28Promo+Only%29-Wushan.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f718086df82854e9e8f2252cd3ef1503a5a76f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,247,24,8,109,248,40,84,233,232,242,37,44,211,239,21,3,165,167,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
