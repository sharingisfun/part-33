Practitioners across many specialties - including urologists, gynecologists, reproductive endocrinologists, medical endocrinologists and many in internal medicine and family practice - will see men with suboptimal fertility and reproductive problems. The book provides an excellent source of timely, well-considered information for those training in this young and rapidly evolving field. While several recent books provide targeted 'cookbooks' for those in a male reproductive laboratory, or quick reference for practising generalists, the modern, comprehensive reference providing both a background for male reproductive medicine as well as clinical practice information based on that foundation has been lacking until now. The book has been extensively revised with a particular focus on modern molecular medicine. Appropriate therapeutic interventions are highlighted throughout.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 688 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 4th edition (October 30, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521872898\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521872898","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e723c4da63c9df51c73cbcbcbb18160dca61820a","amp;dn":"Infertility+in+the+Male%2C4th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e723c4da63c9df51c73cbcbcbb18160dca61820a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,35,196,218,99,201,223,81,199,60,188,188,187,24,22,13,202,97,130,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
