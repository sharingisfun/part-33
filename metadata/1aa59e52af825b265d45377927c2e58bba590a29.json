That's both Toy Soldiers games and all DLC in one $45-value bundle!\r\n\r\n===================================================================================\r\n\r\nThis is the Steam version of Toy Soldiers Complete. This includes Toy Soldiers and Toy Soldiers Cold War along with all DLCs released for both game.\r\n\r\n===================================================================================\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. This is a WineSkin Port. I am not a porting professional so do not expect this to be a perfect port. There may be some bugs but the game is, overall, playable.\r\n\r\n2. I found a bug in the training mission during the boss fight where the Antonov would suddenly disappear or sink to the ground making it impossible to finish the mission. This is not a bug in the port, and is also present in the Windows version of the game. The only solution is to repeat the &quot;wave&quot; and hope the boss doesn't disappear on you again.\r\n\r\n3. I haven't finished testing this yet but I am halfway through the campaign and I have yet to experience a gamebreaking bug. (There is one though where you change the settings of the shadows and the game crashes but its a rare case and the solution is to simply reopen the game).\r\n\r\n4. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa59e52af825b265d45377927c2e58bba590a29","amp;dn":"Toy+Soldiers+Complete+%28Mac+OS+X%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa59e52af825b265d45377927c2e58bba590a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,165,158,82,175,130,91,38,93,69,55,121,39,194,229,139,186,89,10,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
