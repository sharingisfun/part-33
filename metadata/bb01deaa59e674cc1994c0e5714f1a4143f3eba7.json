The film is based on a story by Philip MacDonald and stars William Terry, Virginia Grey, Helene Thimig and Edith Barrett and Anne O'Neal. It is a Republic Pictures production, produced by Rudolph E. Abel.\nOur overall rating for Strangers in the Night is: good. \n\nThe inky noir style and fatalist themes that would emerge full force in director Anthony MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s T-Men (1948) and Border Incident (1949) begin to take shape in this, MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sixth feature, an early gothic B-thriller about a returning vet lured into a psychological nightmare by the promise of love.\n\nWhile recovering from combat wounds he received in the South Pacific, Marine Sergeant Johnny Meadows starts up a correspondence with a woman whose name he finds written inside a book of poetry, A. E. HousmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Shropshire Lad. The exchange turns romantic and MeadowsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sights turn to Monteflores, California, where his mysterious pen pal, Rosemary Blake, lives and where he heads after his release. Upon arriving at the brooding, cliffside Blake mansion, however, Meadows meets RosemaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, Hilda Blake, who invites him in and makes excuses for her absent daughter: Rosemary will be back soon and then theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll all be happy. The shadows close in from there as Meadows and the townÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new doctor, Leslie Ross, begin to unravel HildaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s veil of secrecy, threatening to expose a dangerous and deadly truth.\n\nHelene Thimig, as Hilda Blake, turns in a wickedly over-the-top performance as a woman on the edge as Mann displays his facility with making the most of a tight budget.\n\nNo one would argue that Strangers in the Night is Anthony MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best film. As the saying goes, the best was yet to come. That said, it remains a taught, engaging little noir that proved to be an opportunity for a terrific director to flex some muscles, not mention the haunting performance by Helene Thimig.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 859mb\nDuration.... 00:56:08\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 988\nFrame Height.... 720\nData Rate.... 2016kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
