Of the five pieces here, two, &quot;That The Peace,&quot;\nand &quot;Evening Might Still&quot; were written purposely for the trio plus horns; they\nscore in lots of room for improvisation and dynamic while being closely\narranged. Of the others which were written for the trio and expanded upon, the\n&quot;La Mezquita Suite,&quot; which encompasses four different compositions, explores how\nmany pairings and trios can exist inside them. There is plenty of room for\nsoloing, but it is interesting to note how Melford's own role changes from one\nmovement to the next. The title composition is an exercise in both the interplay\nof sonorities and in how, in various intervals, one instrument, when shaded by\nothers, can take on an entirely different persona. In all, Even The Sounds Shine\nis a beautifully guided tour through Melford's musical psyche of the\ntime. Possibilities and problems present themselves with startling regularity\nand are either resolved, transmuted, or abandoned. This is exhilarating\nlistening, and a historical look at Melford's development as a composer as she\nmoved from her trio setting into something more dimensional and challenging.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfe516de01b6acc45216cb8f3cd8ffbf3b6cf8eb","amp;dn":"Myra+Melford+Extended+Ensemble+-+Even+The+Sounds+Shine+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfe516de01b6acc45216cb8f3cd8ffbf3b6cf8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,229,22,222,1,182,172,196,82,22,203,143,60,216,255,191,59,108,248,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
