However, it would be naive to ignore the fact that regenerative medicines pose a whole new set of challenges to an industry sector that for decades has geared itself to the development and delivery of traditional pharmaceuticals.\n\nStill, significant strides are being made. Unique in its focus, The Delivery of Regenerative Medicines and Their Impact on Healthcare delves into material not included in other books. Edited by Dr. Catherine Prescott and Professor Dame Julia Polak, two of the most respected authorities in stem cell research and the business of regenerative medicine, this text presents original firsthand accounts of experts from around the globe. Professor Polak starts by summarizing the progress made and the challenges currently facing the field both as a science and an emerging industry. This is followed by topics relevant to regulators, insurers, and investors as well as pharmaceutical and biotech researchers.
