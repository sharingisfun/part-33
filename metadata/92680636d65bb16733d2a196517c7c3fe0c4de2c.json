Narrated by Pierce Brosnan and shot on the scale of a major motion picture, this dramatized program employs a cast of thousands, location filming, and digital imagery to recreate the ancient wonders as they appeared in their original glory! I.M. Pei leads a team of renowned experts who reveal how the wonders influenced modern architecture and construction design. The Pyramids of Giza, The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, The Colossus of Rhodes, and The Pharos of Alexandria were unbelievably created by human hands with simple tools in the Hellenistic world. Alexander the Great visited most of them during his lifetime and directly influenced the others-tragically dying in one and being buried in the shadow of another.
