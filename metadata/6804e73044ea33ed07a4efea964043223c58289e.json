He said that the source of the leak was a file on Napsterâ€™s file-sharing network. It was  revealed that the bandâ€™s entire catalogue was available, which led Metallica to argue that Napster was enabling users to exchange copyrighted MP3 files. The group went after a minimum of $10 million in damages, at a rate of $100,000 per song that was downloaded.  Metallica hired NetPD, to monitor Napster. They made a list of 335,435 Napster users who were sharing the bandâ€™s songs online . Metallica demanded that all of their songs be banned from file sharing, and that the users sharing their music be banned,resulting in over 300,000 users being banned. Which was a epic fail because users rejoined under a different name. \r\n\r\nA blast from the past huh? Yep, good ol' Metallica the lynchpin for censorship and file deletion from those who only wanted to share. \r\nHow little we knew then, how big and far reaching this actually would be.\r\n\r\nBut Im not here to preach just to remind and share......\r\n\r\nTracklist:  Live &quot;Hammersmith Odeon&quot; Theatre London UK September 21st 1986\r\n\r\n01.
