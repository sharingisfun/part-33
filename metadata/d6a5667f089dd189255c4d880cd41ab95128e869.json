That is the story of the band Chasen. With gifts honed by nearly a decade as a woship pastor, Chasen Challahan, lead singer for Chasen, built a following one person at a time while simultaneously shaping his craft as a songwriter. The band is poised to continue that growth with That Was Then, This Is Now, a melodically-driven, pop-rock musical journey that includes both upbeat tracks and worshipful moments with a clear directional focus towards God.\n\n\n256kbps  mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a5667f089dd189255c4d880cd41ab95128e869","amp;dn":"Chasen-That_Was_Then_This_Is_Now%282010%29-256kbps-RASUNGOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a5667f089dd189255c4d880cd41ab95128e869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,165,102,127,8,157,209,137,37,92,77,136,12,212,26,185,81,40,232,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
