Rhumbas about mermaids, shuffles about trainwrecks, tarantellas about insects, madrigrals about drowning,? says Waits. ?Scared, mean, orphaned songs of rapture and melancholy. Songs that grew up hard. Songs of dubious origin rescued from cruel fate and now left wanting only to be cared for. Show that you are not afraid and take them home. They don?t bite, they just need attention.?\n\nEach of the three CDs is separately grouped and sub-titled ? Brawlers, Bawlers, and Bastards ? to capture the full spectrum of Waits? ranging and roving musical styles. Brawlers is chock full of raucous blues and full-throated juke joint stomp, Bawlers contains Celtic and country ballads, waltzes, lullabies, piano and classic lyrical Waits? songs, while Bastards is filled with experimental music and strange tales.\n\nIn addition to the new work, Orphans... features a number of tracks finding a home on a Waits? album for the first time: songs originally recorded for the cinema, the theatre, and other projects. They include Waits? unique interpretations of songs by the likes of The Ramones, Daniel Johnston, Kurt Weill &amp; Bertolt Brecht, Leadbelly, Kerouac, and Bukowski.\n\nBRAWLERS\n01. Lie To Me\n02.
