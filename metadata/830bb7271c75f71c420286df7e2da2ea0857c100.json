Jane AustenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s England explores the customs and culture of the real England of her everyday existence depicted in her classic novels as well as those by Byron, Keats, and Shelley. Drawing upon a rich array of contemporary sources, including many previously unpublished manuscripts, diaries, and personal letters, Roy and Lesley Adkins vividly portray the daily lives of ordinary people, discussing topics as diverse as birth, marriage, religion, sexual practices, hygiene, highwaymen, and superstitions.\nFrom chores like fetching water to healing with medicinal leeches, from selling wives in the marketplace to buying smuggled gin, from the hardships faced by young boys and girls in the mines to the familiar sight of corpses swinging on gibbets, Jane AustenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s England offers an authoritative and gripping account that is sometimes humorous, often shocking, but always entertaining.\n\nAbout the Author\nLesley and Roy Adkins are authors of eighteen widely acclaimed books on social history, naval history, and archaeology, including the bestselling NelsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trafalgar and The War for All the Oceans. Their books have been translated into sixteen languages worldwide. They live near Exeter in Devon.
