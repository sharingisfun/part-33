Oceanborn has sold more than 68,000 copies in Finland.\nThis album marked a definitive change in musical scope from its folk-laden roots in Angels Fall First, showcasing a more bombastic, power metal-oriented sound with faster tempos, harmonic guitar/keyboard leads, and plenty of double-bass-heavy drumwork. Oceanborn's sound hearkens a more dramatic approach in the overall musical scope, mostly relegated to the symphonic keyboard work and lead singer Tarja Turunen's vocals. Most of the album is fantasy-themed with tracks like &quot;Swanheart&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;, a cover from the animated motion picture The Snowman; however, other songs, such as &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, have a more religious feel to them. In addition, there are also some theatrical tracks like &quot;Devil &amp; the Deep Dark Ocean&quot;. Oceanborn is among their darkest albums, making use of the harsh vocals of Tapio Wilska in the songs &quot;The Pharaoh Sails to Orion&quot; and &quot;Devil &amp; the Deep Dark Ocean&quot;.\n\nCountry: Finland\nGenre: Symphonic metal\nQuality: [FLAC+.cue ] lossless\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Stargazers [04:28]\n02 - Gethsemane [05:22]\n03 - Devil &amp; the deep dark ocean [04:46]\n04 - Sacrament of wilderness [04:12]\n05 - Passion and the opera [04:50]\n06 - Swanheart [04:44]\n07 - Moondance [03:31]\n08 - The riddler [05:15]\n09 - The pharaoh sails to orion [06:26]\n10 - Walking in the air [05:30]\n11 - Sleeping sun [04:04]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db05c2dbe8198696e62f9c46ef03c290c8aab554","amp;dn":"%281998%29+Nightwish+-+Oceanborn+%5BFLAC%2B.cue+%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db05c2dbe8198696e62f9c46ef03c290c8aab554","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,5,194,219,232,25,134,150,230,47,156,70,239,3,194,144,200,170,181,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
