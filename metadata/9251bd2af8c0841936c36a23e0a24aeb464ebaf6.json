NFO .............\n-Golden.Boy.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\nAired Soon\n\n&quot;Pilot&quot;\n\nGOLDEN BOY is a drama about the meteoric \nrise of an ambitious cop who one day will \nbecome the youngest police commissioner in \nthe history of New York City, and the high \npersonal and professional cost he pays to \nachieve it. After only three years as a \nbeat cop, Clarks heroics on the job make \nhim bold enough to ask for and receive the \nunheard-of promotion to homicide \ndetective, angering some members of his \nnew department who are eager to see him \nfail. Clark is partnered with and mentored \nby experienced veteran Detective Don Owen, \njust two years shy of retirement. \nImmediately, Clark comes into conflict \nwith First Grade Detective Christian \nArroyo, the alpha dog in the squad whos \njust as ambitious as Clark, but without a \nmoral center. Arroyos partner is \nDetective Deborah McKenzie, a tough \nthird-generation cop and the only female \ndetective in the unit. Also on the team is \nDetective Joe Diaco, well-connected with \ntremendous resources which Clark might \nfind useful. Though laser-focused on \nmoving up the ladder, Clarks soft spot is \nserving as the sole caregiver and \nsupporter of his sister, Agnes, a teenager \ndemonstrating increasingly dangerous \nbehavior, whom Clark must serve as much a \nparent as a brother. Keenly observant and \npolitically savvy, the Golden Boy often \nbases his career decisions solely on his \nneed to succeed as quickly as possible, \nand hell find that his epic journey will \nbe filled with unexpected consequences. \n\n18/Slower\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9251bd2af8c0841936c36a23e0a24aeb464ebaf6","amp;dn":"Golden.Boy.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9251bd2af8c0841936c36a23e0a24aeb464ebaf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,81,189,42,248,192,132,25,54,195,106,35,224,162,74,235,70,78,186,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
