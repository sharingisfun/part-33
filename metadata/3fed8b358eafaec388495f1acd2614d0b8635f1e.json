These modern transmission systems have emerged as the core technology for Tera-bits per second (bps) and Peta-bps optical Internet for the near future.\n\nFeaturing extensive updates to all existing chapters, Advanced Digital Optical Communications, Second Edition:\n\n- Contains new chapters on optical fiber structures and propagation, optical coherent receivers, DSP equalizer algorithms, and high-order spectral DSP receivers\n- Examines theoretical foundations, practical case studies, and MATLABÃ‚Â® and SimulinkÃ‚Â® models for simulation transmissions\n- Includes new end-of-chapter practice problems and useful appendices to supplement technical information\n- Downloadable content available with qualifying course adoption\n\nAdvanced Digital Optical Communications, Second Edition supplies a fundamental understanding of digital communication applications in optical communication technologies, emphasizing operation principles versus heavy mathematical analysis. It is an ideal text for aspiring engineers and a valuable professional reference for those involved in optics, telecommunications, electronics, photonics, and digital signal processing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fed8b358eafaec388495f1acd2614d0b8635f1e","amp;dn":"Advanced+Digital+Optical+Communications%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fed8b358eafaec388495f1acd2614d0b8635f1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,237,139,53,142,175,174,195,136,73,95,26,205,38,20,208,184,99,95,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
