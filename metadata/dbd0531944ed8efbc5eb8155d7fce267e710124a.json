In the\n          Swedish progressive movement they stood somewhere\n          in the middle, between the politically and the\n          musically progressive branches, where the first\n          mainly played message-based music and the second\n          had more in common with international progressive\n          rock scene. The band did not take a clear\n          political stand, but being less experimental than\n          TrÃƒÂµd, GrÃƒÂµs &amp; Stenar and staying further away from\n          fusion than Samla Mammas Manna, they reached a\n          wide audience. At the end of the &amp;#039;70s, Kebnekaise\n          started to play symphonic rock, and quickly lost\n          much of their popularity.\n          The driving force in Kebnekaise was guitarist\n          Kenny HÃƒâ€¢kansson. In the &amp;#039;60s, he and drummer Pelle\n          Ekman played together in T-Bones and in a band\n          that later changed its name to Baby Grand Mother.\n          In 1969, HÃƒâ€¢kansson, Ekman, and bassist Bengt\n          Linnarsson were recruited as the new backing for\n          Hammond player Mecki Mark, becoming his Mecki Mark\n          Men. In 1971, after a chaotic U.S. tour together\n          with Sly and the Family Stone, Mark left and\n          guitarist Rolf Scherrer was recruited. The new\n          band took the name Kebnekaise after the highest\n          mountain in Sweden, and started out as a mainly\n          instrumental rock band in the tradition of Hendrix\n          and Cream, releasing the debut album Resa Mot\n          OkÃƒÂµnt MÃƒâ€¢l in 1971. For the second album they\n          recruited six new musicians: guitarists GlenngÃƒâ€¢rd\n          and BÃƒÂ·ckler, percussionist Hassan, harmonica\n          player LindstrÃƒÂ·m, and drummer Netzler. Soon\n          bassist GÃƒÂ·ran Lagerberg, who had played with Tages\n          in the &amp;#039;60s, also joined the group. If the first\n          album had been influenced by blues-rock, the\n          harmonies had indeed lacked some blues. On the\n          second, self-titled album, Kebnekaise followed\n          this less-bluesy path into folk-rock, but very\n          Scandinavian folk-rock: melodic and sentimental,\n          mostly played in minor keys. And though Kebnekaise\n          tried out a number of different styles, this was\n          the style that would make them famous.\n\n          In between long tours, the group released their\n          third album, Kebnekaise III, showing more jazz\n          influences than earlier albums but also more\n          African influences, introduced by percussionist\n          Bah, an immigrant from Guinea-Bissau. The entire\n          fourth album was dedicated to African music, but\n          at its release, half of the group had left,\n          leaving Kebnekaise as a five-man band. The\n          following years this disintegration continued,\n          both crew-wise and musically. Elefanten was\n          released in 1977, but despite the title pointing\n          toward Africa, the album was mainly a jazz-rock\n          affair, with clear fusion tendencies. And the folk\n          music, both African and Swedish, was almost gone.\n          After this, HÃƒâ€¢kansson left the band to start a\n          solo career, and with him most of the creativity\n          seemed to have left as well. Together with drummer\n          Pelle Holm and keyboard player Per Lejring, the\n          remaining three members released Vi Drar Vidare in\n          1978, a symphonic rock album that failed to make\n          much impact. The members started to look for other\n          jobs and some time around that year, Kebnekaise\n          ceased to exist. GlenngÃƒâ€¢rd released a few solo\n          albums and worked as a session musician, with\n          ABBA, for example. Bah formed the band the Happy\n          Boys, also including Netzler, but soon moved to\n          Finland.
