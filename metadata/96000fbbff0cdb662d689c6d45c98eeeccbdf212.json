The video was produced in consultation with Professor Philip Mitchell, director of the Mood Disorders Unit at Prince of Wales Hospital, and Dr Meg Smith who is president of the NSW Association for Mental Health and who herself has manic depressive illness. Both Dr Smith and Professor Mitchell appear in the video.\n\nTraditionally manic depressive illness has been treated primarily with medication. While medication remains the centrepiece of treatment there is increasing awareness among consumers and health professionals that treatment requires a combination of medication, counselling, attention to early warning signs of relapse and sensible and informed lifestyle choices. With careful attention to all of these things the outlook for people who have manic depressive illness is optimistic. The people appearing in this video address all these aspects of an integrated approach to staying well.\n\nThe video is intended for people with manic depressive illness, their families and friends, and for health professionals.
