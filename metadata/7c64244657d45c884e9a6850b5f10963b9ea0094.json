She began her recording career in 1916 performing such standards as &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot;, \n&quot;I Ain't Got Nobody Much&quot;, &quot;After You've Gone&quot; and &quot;The Man I Love&quot;. In 1929 she turned down an offer from Universal to substitute her voice for a film player. Instead she made her picture debut in MGM's  Devil May Care (1929) . She died from burns in bed caused by a cigarette fire.\n\n04.03  THE ROARING TWENTIES  - &quot;THE JAZZ AGE &quot; \n\n          Roaring Twenties is a phrase used to describe the 1920s, principally in North America, that emphasizes the period's social, artistic, and cultural dynamism.It was the age of prohibition, it was the age of prosperity, and it was the age of downfall. It was the decade of bath tub gin, the model T, the $5 work day, the first transatlantic flight, and the movie.  At the same time, amusement, fun and lightness were cultivated in jazz and dancing, in defiance of the horrors of World War I, which remained present in people's minds. In music, the three sounds were jazz, jazz, and jazz. The period is also often called &quot;The Jazz Age&quot;. \n\n\nSOPHIE TUCKER  -  Some of These Days   (1911)\nMARION HARRIS  -  AFTER YOU'VE  GONE  (1918)\nMARION HARRIS  -  St.Louis Blues   (1920)\nSOPHIE TUCKER  -  THE LAST OF THE RED HOT MAMAS  (1926)\nMILTON AGER &amp; JACK YALLEN -  AIN'T SHE SWEET  (1928)\nMILTON AGER &amp; JACK YALLEN -  I Ain't Got Nobody Much (and Nobody Cares for Me)  (1928)\nEDYTHE FLYNN - IS SHE MY MY GIRL FRIEND (How de-ow-dow)  (1928)   \nHELEN KANE  -  Don't Be Like That (1928) \nEDYTHE FLYNN  -   What'll You Do  (1928)\nMARION HARRIS   - We love it   (1929)\nETHEL WATERS  -  Am I Blue?
