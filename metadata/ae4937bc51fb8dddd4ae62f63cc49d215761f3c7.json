She rides those new- fangled bicycles and doesn't like to be told what to do. And, in crime fiction, such female detectives as Loveday Brooke, Dorcas Dene, and Lady Molly of Scotland Yard are out there shadowing suspects, crawling through secret passages, fingerprinting corpses, and sometimes committing a lesser crime in order to solve a murder.\n\nIn The Penguin Book of Victorian Women in Crime, Michael Sims has brought together all of the era's great crime-fighting females- plus a few choice crooks, including Four Square Jane and the Sorceress of the Strand.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae4937bc51fb8dddd4ae62f63cc49d215761f3c7","amp;dn":"The+Penguin+Book+of+Victorian+Women+in+Crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae4937bc51fb8dddd4ae62f63cc49d215761f3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,73,55,188,81,251,141,221,212,174,98,246,60,196,157,33,87,97,243,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
