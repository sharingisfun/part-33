It has shortcuts to all the Windows 7 special folders and the multiple tabbed interface allows you to organize your data by projects.\n\nProjects can include files and folders from all over the disks that relate to the project tab and are stored virtually in the project folder as a link. With a new Windows 7 interface WinNc can do all the basic tasks you expect from a modern file manager like copy, move, delete, compress, uncompress and create links.\nWinNc uses logical colors for the file actions so you can quickly see if a file is being copied (green), being moved (orange) or being packed (yellow). WinNc allows you to perform multiple tasks by setting the maximum parallel tasks to more than one task in the configuration panel.\n\nOtherwise WinNc will wait to start the new action until the previous action has finished. WinNc also converts audio, burns files on dvd and cd, creates and reads iso files, sets file attributes and you are able to keep you files synchronized using an internal sync module.\nFrom existing zip files it allows the creation of self extracting .exe files. It has a built in slideshow viewer, an audio preview player and a video player for quickly browsing and skipping through your media.\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 6.3.0.0:\nReleased: 06-06-2014\n\n- Added error log for zip\n- Moved FTP settings to advanced dialog\n- Scaling for FTP advanced dialog\n- Fixed save issues in configuration\n- Added optional file associations for zip, rar etc from configuration\n- Fixed zip archive open in WinNc from anywhere\n- Fixed Registration issues\n- Fixed painting of browser\n- Settings not saved for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Load/Save ConfigÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ options (#207)\n- FTP download/edit not working when rootfolder is used (#187)\n- WinNc zip open files error (#158)\n- Typo in language string 40261, should be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enter password for this archiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (#147)\n- Updated: Fix loading serial key\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n1] Install the program\n2] Run the &quot;Keygen.exe&quot; from folder 'Keygen-BRD'\n3] Use the given 'Name &amp; Serial' from Keygen for registration\n4] Enjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50e4e25cf35514dac4d49f825670f840cb2321f9","amp;dn":"WinNC+v6.3.0.0+Multilingual+Incl.+Keygen-BRD+%5BATOM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50e4e25cf35514dac4d49f825670f840cb2321f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,228,226,92,243,85,20,218,196,212,159,130,86,112,248,64,203,35,33,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
