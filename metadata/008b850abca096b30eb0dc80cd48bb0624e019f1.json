The song appeared on the Hydra album in 1979 and is considered one of the band's biggest hits.\n\nHydra is the second studio album by American rock band Toto, released in 1979. It reached #37 on the Billboard Pop Albums.\n\nThis song written as a tribute to George Lucas' film THX 1138 and the music video resembles a scene in the movie. In this promo video, as in the movie scene where the main character (named &quot;THX-1138&quot;) is imprisoned, the room is completely white and everyone is wearing a white jumpsuit.\n\nToto Legend (the former official International Toto Fan Club newsletter) reviewed this promo video:\n&quot;'99' was predominantly a performance video, though the set design was rather conceptual. Following David Paich's intention regarding the lyrics, about a sterile society in which names are forgotten and love forbidden, the set was sterile white, with various sized sculptured 99's hanging and standing about, and the band was clad in futuristic white jumpsuits. There were some notable shots in this one - keyboard close-ups and an artistic view of Jeff through a transparent drum head, a technique that several popular videos have copied since.&quot;\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/baCoNaaDp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/baCoNaaDp&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 704x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:46\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
