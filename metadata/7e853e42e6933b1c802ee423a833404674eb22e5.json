Williams' amiable, Elton John-like vocals carry the tunes here, most notably the anthemic title track. With its buoyant '70s horn-and-string arrangements, the record sounds charmingly dated, making it ideal for aficionados of that era.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e853e42e6933b1c802ee423a833404674eb22e5","amp;dn":"Paul+Williams+-+Someday+Man+%281970%29+MP3%40256kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e853e42e6933b1c802ee423a833404674eb22e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,133,62,66,230,147,59,28,128,46,228,35,168,51,64,70,116,235,34,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
