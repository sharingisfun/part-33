This EP contains five excellent new tracks, including &quot;Bitter&quot; and &quot;Another Day of Darkness.&quot; Yet the highlight is the bonus second half, which features the band at a live radio show playing standout versions of old classics. &quot;No More Dreams&quot; and &quot;On A Pale Horse&quot; are even more punishing than the originals, and the band even throws in a cover of GBH's &quot;Maniac&quot; to close the disc. Misericordia is a must-have for fans of ruthless and earth-shattering distortion, and despite the amateurish production, proves the band has both feet planted firmly in the competitive ground of hardcore metal.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jadetree.com/releases/product/JT1025&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jadetree.com/releases/product/JT1025&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe935e85ef31a58b39e0418bf2ba80ad30ac0f93","amp;dn":"Damnation+AD+-+Misericordia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe935e85ef31a58b39e0418bf2ba80ad30ac0f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,147,94,133,239,49,165,139,57,224,65,139,242,186,128,173,48,172,15,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
