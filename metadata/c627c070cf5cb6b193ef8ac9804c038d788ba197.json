Elmore and Mark A. Heald\r\nDover Publications | Ocyober 1986 | ISBN-10: 0486649261 | 493 Pages | PDF | 24.1 mb\r\n\r\nBecause of the increasing demands and complexity of undergraduate physics courses (atomic, quantum, solid state, nuclear, etc.), it is often impossible to devote separate courses to the classic wave phenomena of optics, acoustics, and electromagnetic radiation. This brief comprehensive text helps alleviate the problem with a unique overview of classical wave theory in one volume.\r\nBy examining a sequence of concrete and specific examples (emphasizing the physics of wave motion), the authors unify the study of waves, developing abstract and general features common to all wave motion. The fundamental ideas of wave motion are set forth in the first chapter, using the stretched string as a particular model. A special feature of this book is the inclusion of additional material designed to encourage the serious student to investigate topics often not covered in lectures. Throughout, the mathematics is kept relatively simple (mostly differential equations) and is accessible to advanced undergraduates with a year of calculus. In addition, carefully selected problems at the end of each section extend the coverage of the text by asking the student to supply mathematical details for calculations outlined in the section, or to develop the theory for related cases.\r\nImpressively broad in scope, Physics of Waves offers a novel approach to the study of classical wave theory â€” a wide-ranging but thorough survey of an important discipline that pervades much of contemporary physics. The simplicity, breadth, and brevity of the book make it ideal as a classroom text or as a vehicle for self-study.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface vii\r\n1 Transverse Waves on a String 1\r\n2 Waves on a Membrane 50\r\n3 Introduction to the Theory of Elasticity 71\r\n4 One-dimensional Elastic Waves 93\r\n5 Acoustic Waves in Fluids 135\r\n6 Waves on a Liquid Surface 176\r\n7 Elastic Waves in Solids 206\r\n8 Electromagnetic Waves 237\r\n9 Wave Propagation in Inhomogeneous and Obstructed Media 309\r\n10 Fraunhofer Diffraction 341\r\n11 Fresnel Diffraction 392\r\n12 Spectrum Analysis of Waveforms 416\r\nAppendices\r\nA.
