Taken from his second solo album Can&amp;#039;t Slow Down, it combined Richie&amp;#039;s soulful Commodores style with Caribbean influences and contains an old Jamaican chant. This new, more dance approach proved popular, as the single reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on the UK Singles Chart. An accompanying music video was directed by former Monkee and TV video pioneer Michael Nesmith. According to an episode of Reading Rainbow in which Richie guest-starred, the song&amp;#039;s theme is about a party that lasts all night long.\n\nThe Cheetah Girls song &quot;Fuego&quot; sampled parts from this song.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0622eb4ffe468168b50638cea719551e9d4815d8","amp;dn":"Lionel+Richie+-+All+Night+Long","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0622eb4ffe468168b50638cea719551e9d4815d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,34,235,79,254,70,129,104,181,6,56,206,167,25,85,30,157,72,21,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
