Definitely a unique concert. When Michael Dorf started the show by announcing that Patti Smith was ill and that The Roots were not performing I was definitely disappointed, but that's show business. You can read about what happened with The Roots here: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-roots-bilal-kimbra-pull-out-of-bowie-tribute-concerts-20160330. As usual for rock shows that I've attended at this venue, the acoustics were pretty poor, and it's well captured in this recording. A second show at Radio City Music Hall is tonight, but I'm not there. Maybe someone else? I video recorded only one song, but it's a good one:\r\n  \r\nSetlist:\r\n01 intro - Michael Dorf, producer\r\n02 Suffragette City - Cyndi Lauper\r\n03 Width Of A Circle - Holy Holy\r\n04 Soul Love - Robyn Hitchcock\r\n05 Always Crashing In The Same Car - Laurie Anderson\r\n06 Breaking Glass - Gogol Bordello\r\n07 Starman - Debbie Harry (with Matt Katz-Bohen)\r\n08 The Man Who Sold The World - Joseph Arthur\r\n09 Word On A Wing - The Mountain Goats (with Robyn Hitchcock)\r\n10 Ashes To Ashes - Michael Stipe and Karen Elson\r\n11 Quicksand - J Mascis and Sean Lennon\r\n12 It Ain't Easy - Bettye LaVette\r\n13 Rebel Rebel - Perry Farrell\r\n14 Five Years - Cat Power\r\n15 Let's Dance - Ann Wilson\r\n16 Cactus - Pixies\r\n17 All The Young Dudes - Ricki Lee Jones\r\n18 Heroes - Jakob Dylan\r\n19 Life On Mars - The Flaming Lips\r\n20 Space Oddity - Choir Choir! and audience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55ae252a927efd642dddb05866334716ea234809","amp;dn":"The+Music+of+David+Bowie+2016-03-31+New+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55ae252a927efd642dddb05866334716ea234809","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,174,37,42,146,126,253,100,45,221,176,88,102,51,71,22,234,35,72,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
