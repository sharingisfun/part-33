This is the most comprehensive collection of his earliest recordings ever released and is the first time ever on CD that all his A and B sides have been compiled chronologically in one collection.\nFeatures all the Jimmy Reed classics that you would expect: 'Baby What You Want Me to Do'; 'Bright Lights Big City'; 'Honest I Do'; 'You Don't Have to Go'; 'Going to New York'; 'Ain't That Lovin' You Baby' and 'Big Boss Man'.\nRead more at http://www.israbox.com/1146446549-jimmy-reed-aint-that-loving-you-baby-singles-as-bs-1953-1961-2013.html#YSkau5xxO7JI2To8.99\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d911bcd60f24a1b7f538dd4967e75b8c5f510c75","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Reed+-+Ain%27t+That+Loving+You+Baby+Singles+As+%26amp%3B+Bs%2C+195","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d911bcd60f24a1b7f538dd4967e75b8c5f510c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,17,188,214,15,36,161,183,245,56,221,73,103,231,91,140,95,81,12,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
