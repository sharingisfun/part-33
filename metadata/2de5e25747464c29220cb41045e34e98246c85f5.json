The motivation comes from the father, Allie Fox, who is a character in the classic American mold. A cantankerous inventor, he is articulate, shrewd, scornful, funny, very angry, and slightly cracked. An individualist, Fox sees modern American culture as a despicable combination of the wasteful, the immoral, and the messy. Uprooting his family from their Massachusetts farm home, he takes them off to a primitive world in order to escape what he considers the imminent breakdown of civilization.\n\nThe Mosquito Coast has the fascination of an ironic version of Robinson Crusoe or a sardonic Swiss Family Robinson, along with the deeper levels akin to those of The Lord of the Flies. As a sheer teller of tales Theroux is at the top of his form, but he also succeeds as a moralist with a subtle fable in mind.\n\nThe story is told with fresh innocence by the fourteen year old Charlie, who observes his father with a mixture of love, horror, and astonishment. He describes the voyage, the trip into the interior, his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s invention of a giant ice-making machine (which is supposed to bring a new era to the jungle), and all of the adventures that ensue. Charlie watches as his father becomes ever more obsessive, evermore lost to reality.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de5e25747464c29220cb41045e34e98246c85f5","amp;dn":"The+Mosquito+Coast+-+Paul+Theroux++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de5e25747464c29220cb41045e34e98246c85f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,229,226,87,71,70,76,41,34,12,180,16,69,227,78,152,36,108,133,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
