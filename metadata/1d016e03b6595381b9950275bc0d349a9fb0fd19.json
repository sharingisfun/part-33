Look what I found... 10 more rare and hard to find games. This should be enough to keep you busy this weekend - enjoy, and seed, or I will find you... :-)\n\nMost of these are missing, dead or just slow here on TPB (or a 4GB iso instead of a 300MB WBFS!), so hopefully this will help fill some gaps. \n\nGame Name: Wii Pirates PlundARRR\nGame ID  : [SPAE5G]\nLanguage : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType     : Arcade Adventure\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of my 700+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/rbsm&lt;/a&gt; \n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard - that was so crap I deleted it straight away, so not got that anyway!)\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d016e03b6595381b9950275bc0d349a9fb0fd19","amp;dn":"Wii+Pirates+PlundARRR+%5BSPAE5G%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d016e03b6595381b9950275bc0d349a9fb0fd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,1,110,3,182,89,83,129,185,149,2,117,188,13,52,154,159,176,253,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
