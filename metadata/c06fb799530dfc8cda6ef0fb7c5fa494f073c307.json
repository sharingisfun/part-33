Worldwide Quest3D is used for product- and design visualizations, architecture demos, training facilities and simulators, games, film productions and TV broadcasting solutions. The visual Object-Oriented development environment allows users to develop their products in real-time: what you see is what you get. Compared to programming environments, such as C++, C# and Java, Quest3D is much more cost-effective, pragmatic and less time-consuming. Applications developed with Quest3D can be published to stand-alone executables, or a setup program that installs the application. It is also possible to embed the Quest3D application on other programs or expose it on the web, using the Quest3D ActiveX Control. All Quest3D applications run on the Microsoft Windows platform with DirectX 9.\n\nInstallation instruction:\nLook in the &quot;crack&quot; directory, select needed edition and copy .exe file to directory where Quest3D installed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06fb799530dfc8cda6ef0fb7c5fa494f073c307","amp;dn":"Quest3D+v4.2.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06fb799530dfc8cda6ef0fb7c5fa494f073c307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,111,183,153,83,13,252,140,218,110,240,251,124,95,164,148,240,115,195,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
