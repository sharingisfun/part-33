Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill who comes to stay with his Aunt Rachel for the summer. The three children are terrified and fascinated with a phantom neighbor named \\&quot;Boo\\&quot; Radley, a mysterious recluse the adults of Maycomb are hesitant to speak of and who few have seen for many years. The children feed each other\\&amp;#039;s imaginations with rampant rumors about his grotesque appearance and his reasons for remaining a recluse, while dreaming of ways to get him to emerge from his house.\n\nPlease seed 1:1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:868f7cf34a270e126e2af3a7af0c5b8f2f370a5c","amp;dn":"Harper+Lee+-+To+Kill+A+Mockingbird","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"868f7cf34a270e126e2af3a7af0c5b8f2f370a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,143,124,243,74,39,14,18,110,42,243,167,175,12,91,143,47,55,10,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
