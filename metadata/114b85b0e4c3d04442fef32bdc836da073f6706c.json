Its narrative flaws were criticized from the start, and its length and elaborately formal prose style have reduced its appeal to later readers. Regardless, The Last of the Mohicans is widely read in American literature courses.\nPlot:\n\nThe story is set in the British province of New York during the French and Indian War, and concerns a Huron massacre (with passive French acquiescence) of from 500 to 1,500 Anglo-American troops, who had honorably surrendered at Fort William Henry, plus some women and servants; the kidnapping of two sisters, daughters of the British commander; and their rescue by the last two Mohicans, and others. Parts of the story may have been derived from the capture and death of Jane McCrea in July 1777 near Fort Edward, New York, by members of an Algonquian tribe.\n\nThe title of the book comes from a quote by Tamanend: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have lived to see the last warrior of the wise race of the MohicansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.[3]\n\nSummary by Wikipedia.org (GNU FDL)\n\n\nMore free Public Domain Literature and Audiobooks on www.opencast.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:114b85b0e4c3d04442fef32bdc836da073f6706c","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+The+Last+of+the+Mohicans+by+James+Fenimore+Cooper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"114b85b0e4c3d04442fef32bdc836da073f6706c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,75,133,176,228,195,208,68,66,254,243,43,220,131,109,160,115,246,112,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
