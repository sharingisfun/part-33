The theme attempts to rebuild that idea of a personal website, incorporating a lifestream carousel alongside standard blog posts, keeping your fragmented data all in one place.\nThe lifestream code was inspired by Kieran DelaneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s WP plugin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSimpleLifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, but rewritten to fix bugs and caching issues. The code is built right into the functions.php file, with control panel options which include contact form configuration. There are other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“personal siteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ touches - a user profile box with gravatar and bio, plus the built-in contact form. First-time visitors get an easy sense of who you are, what services you use, and how to get in touch.\nThe design itself intentionally deviates from the standard WordPress layout. Hierarchy is key - lesser content modules (Subcategories, Pages, Monthly Archives, Search) are tucked away so the user stays primarily focused on recent blog posts and recent lifestream items. Newer items are lighter with a larger font size, and get incrementally smaller and darker as they get older.\nThe theme also contains a custom Archives page. In the past, blindly clicking a monthly archive link (ex: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNovember 2006ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â³) has never been useful to me, so I decided to display all posts in a grid format, chronologically, and categorized by month and year. If you find bugs, please leave a comment. We will continue upgrading the theme as necessary.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a45e28532210d8f75a310dd9b7802bd783bd2c5","amp;dn":"%28Wordpress%29+Fantastic+Agregado+Theme+-+DLLOZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a45e28532210d8f75a310dd9b7802bd783bd2c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,69,226,133,50,33,13,143,117,163,16,221,155,120,2,189,120,59,210,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
