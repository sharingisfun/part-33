The series \nis set in an alternate version of the Marvel Universe (Earth-2149)[1] where almost \nall superheroes and super villains have become flesh-eating zombies. The series was \nwritten by Robert Kirkman and illustrated by Sean Phillips, with painted covers by \nArthur Suydam; it ties in with an Ultimate Fantastic Four story and has proved a \nbreakout hit with a prequel one-shot &amp; crossover miniseries and appearances by its \ncharacters in other Marvel titles.\n\nThe zombie universe resembles a classic incarnation of the Marvel Universe (several \ncharacters like Luke Cage wear their seventies costumes), with slight differences \nsuch as Captain America being Colonel America.  The Army of Darkness crossover expands \nthis by showing zombie versions of Howard the Duck and Runaways, as well as an appearance \nby Nextwave.\n\n\n\nIssues Included:\n\n00 - Marvel Zombies, Dead Days (One-Shot).cbr                                                            \n01 - Marvel Zombies, Ultimate Fantastic Four #021.cbr                                                   \n02 - Marvel Zombies, Ultimate Fantastic Four #022.cbr                                                    \n03 - Marvel Zombies, Ultimate Fantastic Four #023.cbr                                                    \n04 - Marvel Zombies #1 of 5.cbr                                                                          \n05 - Marvel Zombies #2 of 5.cbr                                                                          \n06 - Marvel Zombies #3 of 5.cbr                                                                          \n07 - Marvel Zombies #4 of 5.cbr                                                                          \n08 - Marvel Zombies #5 of 5.cbr                                                                          \n09 - Marvel Zombies, Ultimate Fantastic Four #030.cbr                                                    \n10 - Marvel Zombies, Ultimate Fantastic Four #031.CBR                                                    \n11 - Marvel Zombies, Ultimate Fantastic Four #032.cbr                                                    \n12 - Marvel Zombies Tie-In, Black Panther (v4) #28 - #1 of 4.cbr                                              \n13 - Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #1 of 5.cbr                                                          \n14 - Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #2 of 5.cbr                                                          \n15 - Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #3 of 5.cbr                                                          \n16 - Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #4 of 5.cbr  \n\n\n\n**Note**  These Issues are still not out:\n\nMarvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #5\nBlack Panther # 29-31\n      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aec2d6643b5d1b108581b3a0d86540eb211acb8","amp;dn":"Marvel+Zombies+Collection+-+Complete+%28As+of+June+29%2C+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aec2d6643b5d1b108581b3a0d86540eb211acb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,236,45,102,67,181,209,177,8,88,27,58,13,134,84,14,178,17,172,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
