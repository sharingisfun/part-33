After recording and sending a demo tape with an unused song from Toni Braxton, Spears signed a multi-album deal with Jive. &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; is a teen pop and dance-pop song that refers to a girl who regrets breaking up with her boyfriend. The song received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its composition.\n    &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the chart two and a half months later for two consecutive weeks, replacing R&amp;B-singer Brandy's &quot;Have You Ever?&quot;.

One of the earliest live covers of the song was by Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at &quot;The Bay Tavern&quot; in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England. The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, &quot;Turn&quot;. Lead singer Francis Healey said, &quot;We did it for a laugh the first time. And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very well-crafted song. It has that magic thing.&quot;\n       The Guardian said this cover showed a new and more &quot;dark&quot; side of the band, commenting &quot;slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet &quot;This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time&quot; sounded&quot;. PopWreckoning.com called it &quot;perhaps the most well done cover of BritneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s catalyst to eternal fame&quot;. Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, &quot;It was so weird. I liked it though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903ae7bfdcb7fb448ec6c9dca192b486d45fea37","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+378","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903ae7bfdcb7fb448ec6c9dca192b486d45fea37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,58,231,191,220,183,251,68,142,198,201,220,161,146,180,134,212,95,234,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
