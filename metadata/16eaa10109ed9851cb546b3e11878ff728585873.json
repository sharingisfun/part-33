The only limit is your imagination and creativity!\n\nFeatures\n\n- All photographic parameters are adjustable and always at hand: exposure compensation, ISO, light metering mode, focus mode, white balance and program mode.\n- DSLR-like viewfinder display: see exposure time, aperture and stops display with EV and bracketing settings.\n- Full fledged exposure bracketing: from 3 to 7 frames, unlimited stops spacing, plus custom EV shifting.\n- Built-in intervalometer: make stunning timelapses (even bracketed/HDR timelapses) and time-controlled picture series.\n- Program and Speed-priority modes.\n- Long exposure support: take beautiful night photos and light trails with long exposure times up to 60 seconds*.\n- JPEG as well as RAW (PNG) image formats for lossless photo capturing, perfect for post-processing.\n- EXIF and XMP sidecar metadata support.\n- Self timer for delayed shooting.\n- Autofocus, macro, touch-to-focus** and infinity focus modes, plus a focus lock switch (AF-L).\n- In background photo developing and processing allows a smooth, uninterrupted camera operation.\n- This camera application completely avoids scene modes, instead you get full manual control over all photographic parameters, just like you do with a reflex camera, so you can ultimately control every aspect of the picture, and leave the post-processing to the computer. So after your DSLR, you will never miss a photo opportunity again, being able to capture it with the closer sensation to your DSLR as possible.\n\nWhat's in this version\n\n- Improved: although Android 4.4 KitKat has blocked access to the external SD card, a new hack makes it possible to select the external SD card for saving photos on \ncertain devices (mostly Samsung).\n\n\nORIGINALLY UPLOADED TO\nFollow me on kickass torrents\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16eaa10109ed9851cb546b3e11878ff728585873","amp;dn":"Camera_FV-5_v1.65.apk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16eaa10109ed9851cb546b3e11878ff728585873","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,234,161,1,9,237,152,81,203,84,107,62,17,135,143,247,40,88,88,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
