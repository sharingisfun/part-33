Ever since the suicide of its patriarch, the \nHammonds, an old and wealthy English family has seemingly lived under a curse. \nWhen a number of murders occur on the Hammond estate, Scotland Yard inspector \nBob Curtis (James Ellison) and his garrulous female assistant Christy (Heather \nThatcher) are sent out to investigate. Everyone on the premises-Helga Hammond \n(Heather Angel), her brother Oliver (John Howard), family doctor Geoffrey Covert \n(Bramwell Fletcher), family servants Mr. and Mrs. Walton (Halliwell Hobbes and \nEily Malyon)-seems to know more than he or she is letting on. Only in the final \nfew minutes of the film is the horrible family secret revealed and the murderer \ndispensed with. Atmospherically directed by John Brahm on several impressive \nstanding sets (that gigantic stained-glass window is a knockout!), The Undying \nMonster is a model &quot;B&quot; picture, hampered only by Heather Thatcher's intrusive \ncomedy relief.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAST\nJames Ellison             - Bob Curtis\nHeather Angel             - Helga Hammond\nJohn Howard               - Oliver Hammond\nBramwell Fletcher         - Dr. Geoffrey Covert\nHeather Thatcher          - Christy\nAubrey Mather             - Inspector Craig\nHalliwell Hobbes          - Walton\nEily Malyon               - Mrs. Walton\nHeather Wilde             - Millie\nCharles McGraw            - Stredwick\nAlec Craig                - Will\nHolmes Herbert            - Constable\nClive Morgan              - Foster\nDavid Thursby             - Miles McGregor\nDonald Stuart             - Charles Clagpool\nJohn Rogers               - Tom Clagpool\nMatthew Boulton           - Coroner \n\nCREW\n\nJohn Brahm                - Director\nBryan Foy                 - Producer\nLillie Hayward            - Screenwriter\nMichel Jacoby             - Screenwriter\nJessie Douglas Kerruish   - Book Author\nLucien Ballard            - Cinematographer\nEmil Newman               - Composer (Music Score)\nDavid Raksin              - Composer (Music Score)\nHarry Reynolds            - Editor\nLewis H.

This monster now attacks people who wander the woods alone on moonlit \nnights. Creating the template for British crime procedurals for generations to \ncome, a sardonic and weathered detective (James Ellison) agrees to help a brazen \nand skeptical heiress (played by cult icon Heather Angel) to get to the bottom \nof the curse while a twitchy, doomsayer butler warns them all of the grave, \nunspeakable things the curse has wrought.\n\nThe film effectively maintains an atmosphere of dread despite scenes with \nVictorian-era DNA testing and the sudden realization that the empty sarcophagus \nin the basement might be a clue. And under the claustrophobic lens of Lucien \nBallard (The House on Telegraph Hill, The Wild Bunch), the family's sweeping \nmansion begins to feel like a gothic prison.\n\nDVD extras include &quot;Concerto Macabre: The Films of John Brahm,&quot; a 15-minute \nretrospective of director's work, trailer, advertising images and an overview of \nthe box set's restoration process.\n\n\nSome IMDB review\n\nEnjoyed taping this film recently, which was shown during the early hours of the \nAM. It is a great picture from the 1940's and director John Brahm, who also \ndirected such film greats as, &quot;Hangover Square&quot;,'45 and &quot;The Lodger&quot;,'44, \nstarring Laid Cregar. Twentieth Century-Fox produced this film which is from a \ngood novel taken from Jessie Douglas Kerruish's 1936 book. It is a tale of a \nfamily cursed since the Crusades and is rather moody stuff, quite spoilt by the \nBritish censor's scissors. Not only did he remove the carefully photographed \nfinal metamorphosis, leaving audiences to wonder why the dim thing that the \npolice shot should suddenly look like John Howard, but he also insisted on the \ntitle being changed to The Hammond Mystery. Fortunately enough of Brahm's \nbrilliance was devoted to less shocking sequences so that most of his mood \nremained. Lucien Ballard swung his camera round as ancient room, alighting on \nodd objects at each dour bong of midnight. He also showed a large stain glass \nwindow which made the old homestead very creapy. The phrase: When the stars are \nbright on a frosty night, Beware the baying in the rocky lane&quot; You will have to \nsee the picture to find out what the MONSTER REALLY IS ! \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nthe first time I saw this horror classic was on TV in the 1950s and it really \nscared me particularly the ending when the monsters face is shown as it appears \non the side of the rocks .And I couldn't sleep that night because I kept seeing \nthe monsters face.And after for several years of searching for it I went to a \nmovie show in New York City and found it and of course purchased it.And have \nwatched it several times over the past years .And indeed enjoyed it even \nmore.And the entire cast from john Howard heather angel James Ellison halliwell \nHobbes and the rest all did a spectacular job.And the spooky music and foggy \nsets added to the creepies of the movie .Excellent Movie Classic \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMEDIAINFO REPORT\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.03 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 3mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 329 Kbps\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2009-02-07 13:04:42\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v2.2.0 ('Turn It On Again') built on \nMar  4 2008 12:58:26\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;
