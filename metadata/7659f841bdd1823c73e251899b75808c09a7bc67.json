Ruhtenberg, J. Efroymson / Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art\n2013 / 58 / English / PDF / 24 MB\n\nSimply put, Jan Ruhtenberg is the greatest architect you've never heard of. His accomplishments are astonishing: an apprentice and colleague of Mies van der Rohe during his most significant projects; a close confidant of Philip Johnson who helped introduce modernism to America; a man who escaped Nazi Germany to design projects for Herman Miller, Greta Garbo, Nelson Rockefeller and the Swedish Royal Family. However, as Jan approached the pinnacle of his profession, he was outed as a gay man in conservative 1950's America. Jan's commissions disappeared and he all but vanished from the history of modern architecture. This exhibition begins a process of reintroducing the world to one of its great architects and designers. Curated by Vess von Ruhtenberg and Jeremy Efroymson. Exhibit and catalog made possible by The Efroymson Family Fund and The Tracy L.
