It is the story of four generations of a singular family, living in a house that is many houses on the magical border of an otherworld. It is a story of fantastic love and heartrending loss; of impossible things and unshakable destinies; and of the great Tale that envelops us all. It is a wonder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f804c84f03796555d8c506271865fa00134f0d6e","amp;dn":"LITTLE%2C+BIG+-+John+Crowley+%281982+World+Fantasy+Award+Winner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f804c84f03796555d8c506271865fa00134f0d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,4,200,79,3,121,101,85,216,197,6,39,24,101,250,0,19,79,13,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
