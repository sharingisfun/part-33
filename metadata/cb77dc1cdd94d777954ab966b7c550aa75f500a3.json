He's about 30, solitary, quiet, and big. He watches TV, likes heavy metal, and sometimes works as a bouncer at a disco. One night he notices one of the cleaning crew, Julia; he watches her via the cameras as she works, then follows some days as she goes to an Internet cafÃƒÂ©, the beach, shopping, or the movies. He stays out of her sight and never talks to her. Thinking she may be hiding somewhere in the store with a male co-worker, Jarita breaks some rules and gets suspended. Then, while watching her one evening, she meets a man. What will Jara do?\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb77dc1cdd94d777954ab966b7c550aa75f500a3","amp;dn":"Gigante+aka+Giant+2009+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb77dc1cdd94d777954ab966b7c550aa75f500a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,119,220,28,221,148,215,119,149,74,185,102,183,197,80,170,117,245,0,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
