You can create your own paintings from nothing, load in photos and recreate them with oil paints, pencils, felt pens, or any of the other tools ArtRage has to offer. You can experiment with metallic paint for gold leafing, sprinkle shiny glitter, fill in large areas with the paint roller, and generally paint, smudge, and smear your way to your very own masterpiece. This new version of ArtRage comes in two versions. The Full Edition gives you all the new features, including four new tools, layers, metal paints, and much more for only $19.95US. The Free Edition contains all of the features of ArtRage 1, plus the speed and technology improvements in ArtRage 2 and a few new features for good measure.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ambientdesign.com/artragepress.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ambientdesign.com/artragepress.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2e98312dca4d4aec154bcddff61da201a117a50","amp;dn":"ArtRage+2.5.20+Full+Edition+%28INSTALLER+%2B+KEYGEN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2e98312dca4d4aec154bcddff61da201a117a50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,233,131,18,220,164,212,174,193,84,188,221,255,97,218,32,26,17,122,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
