EP. A 3 song EP, which is also the first part of a three part release that will be coming out every week. The EP features Ã¯Â¿Â½DRAK NIGHTÃ¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½DEAFÃ¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½TWARKÃ¯Â¿Â½, all packing all the signautre sounds with a certain ravey almost hardstyle vibe to it. They still maintain the trap roots, but venture in some foreign territory. Turn up the bass, let this kick, stay tuned for parts 2 and 3. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88ec60aa680708744ece4fea98359fe4316bdbf","amp;dn":"%5BREQ%5D+Flosstradamus-+X1+%5B2012%2Fmp3%2F320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88ec60aa680708744ece4fea98359fe4316bdbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,142,198,10,166,128,112,135,68,236,228,254,169,131,89,254,67,22,189,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
