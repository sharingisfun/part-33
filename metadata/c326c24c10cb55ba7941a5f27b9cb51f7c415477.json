After being punched in the nose by the captain of the vessel for smart-mouthing him, Harvey quickly learns respect, toughness, and gratitude. He steps up from self-centeredness into the difficult but fulfilling realm of self-reliance and unselfishness. A popular favorite since its first publication in 1897, the novel remains a classic story of youthful initiation and a lively tribute to the author's famous code of bravery, loyalty, and honor among men.\nRead by Nadia May\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n-------------------------\nVisit us:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c326c24c10cb55ba7941a5f27b9cb51f7c415477","amp;dn":"Captains+Courageous+%26ndash%3B+Rudyard+Kipling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c326c24c10cb55ba7941a5f27b9cb51f7c415477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,38,194,76,16,203,85,186,121,65,165,242,123,156,181,31,124,65,84,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
