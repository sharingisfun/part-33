The playfulness of Zizek's text, however, is entirely different from that associated with the deconstructive approach made famous by Derrida. By clarifying what Lacan is saying as well as what he is not saying, Zizek is uniquely able to distinguish Lacan from the poststructuralists who so often claim him.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa0214b601d8239be927e645a6351af74173eccd","amp;dn":"Zizek%2C+Slavoj+-+Looking+Awry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa0214b601d8239be927e645a6351af74173eccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,2,20,182,1,216,35,155,233,39,230,69,166,53,26,247,65,115,236,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
