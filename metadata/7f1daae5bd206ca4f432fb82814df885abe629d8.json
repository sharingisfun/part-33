I wasn't resizing first since it cuts the uncompressed data by just over 100GB. Which to me, didn't sound good, but I think it actually does look better.\n\nSo feel free to let me know how you think it compares to my previous rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f1daae5bd206ca4f432fb82814df885abe629d8","amp;dn":"Supernatural+S05E20+HQ+HDTV+AC3+DivX+%28Re-Encode+From+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f1daae5bd206ca4f432fb82814df885abe629d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,29,170,229,189,32,108,164,244,50,251,130,129,77,248,133,171,230,41,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
