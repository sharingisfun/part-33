Kennedy, DDS. \n\nHe is a well respected preventive dentist in San Diego, California and has practised in San Diego for more than 20 years.

Dr. Kennedy is the past president of International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, the author of a book on preventive dental health entitled How to Save Your Teeth, and a nationally and internationally recognized lecturer on toxicology and restorative dentistry.\n\nHowever, Dr. David C. Kennedy, DDS., is not like most dentists, he does not like Fluoride and that is with good reason, it is a poison, it is toxic and has been linked to Cancer, Hip Fractures, Dental Fluorosis, bone damage and even death.\n\nIt should be known that 97% of western Europe has chosen fluoride-free water. Now, why is that? Fluoride is an industrial waste product, some people use it as a pesticide.\n\nThis audio is 1 hour 2 minutes long.\n\n---\n\nAfter listening to this audio, consider writing your congressman, your state electors, you know? the people who work for you and want your family to be safe. Tell them that you do not want fluoride in your drinking water. If you really want Fluoride, you should be given the choice, but not be forced by having it. We have the right to be able to choose fluoride or fluoride-free toothpaste, but why not water?\n\nEnjoy and make sure to seed this for others to enjoy and remember, share with your family and friends, even your dentist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3111e07de333278d8ab18c390cabb4712b601f3","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+Dangers+of+Fluoride+by+Dr.+David+Kennedy%2C+DDS.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3111e07de333278d8ab18c390cabb4712b601f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,17,30,7,222,51,50,120,216,171,24,195,144,202,187,71,18,182,1,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
