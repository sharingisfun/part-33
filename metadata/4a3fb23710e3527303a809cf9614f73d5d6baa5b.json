Teruo Ishii is the brilliant director responsible for films such as &quot;Female Yakuza Tale&quot;, &quot;The Black Cat's Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Executioner&quot; or &quot;Horrors Of Malformed Men&quot;. Kazuo Koike is the genius writer behind such masterpieces as the &quot;Kozure ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½kami&quot; films with Tomisaburo Wakayama, the &quot;Hanzo The Razor&quot; films with Shintaro Katsu, or &quot;Lady Snowblood&quot; with Meiko Kaji (Koike wrote the comic-books these films were based on, and, in most cases, the screenplays). The pairing of Koike and Ishii promises something stylish, brutal and sleazy, and this memorable film truly has all these attributes. While &quot;Porno Jidaigeki&quot; is not one of the most memorable Chambara/Sexploitation crossovers (films like &quot;Hanzo The Razor: Sword Of Justice&quot; and &quot;Sex And Fury&quot; come with my highest possible recommendations) this is definitely a very interesting, blood-soaked and delightfully sleazy film that fans of Japanese Exploitation cinema should not miss.\n\nIn 17th century Japan, a Ronin named Shiro (Tetsuro Tamba) is recruited by the ruthless Bohachi-Clan, which controls prostitution in the area. The Bohachi-Clan's forces include the 'Bohachi Women', some sort of mixture between prostitutes and beautiful but lethal (and mostly naked) female assassins. Shiro is to wipe out the Clan's competitors in prostitution business... Tetsuro Tamba is stone-cold and bad-ass as always, and he was the perfect choice to play Shiro. The yummy female cast members are naked for about 99% of their screen time, and the film is filled with vast amounts of perverted sleaze as well as lost of stylish bloodshed, so most of my fellow Exploitation-lovers should be satisfied. The score is also pretty cool, and the photography and choreography are great. The story may be a bit messy, but the film's great style, and, especially, the sexy female cast and tons of sleaze and violence make up for this easily. Overall, &quot;Bohachi: Clan Of The Forgotten Eight&quot; is a more than entertaining film that should satisfy all my fellow fans of Japanese Exploitation cinema. Highly Recommended. My rating: 7.5/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a3fb23710e3527303a809cf9614f73d5d6baa5b","amp;dn":"Bohachi-Clan.of.the.Forgotten.Eight.1973.DVDRip.XviD-KamuiX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a3fb23710e3527303a809cf9614f73d5d6baa5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,63,178,55,16,227,82,115,3,168,9,207,150,20,247,61,93,107,170,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
