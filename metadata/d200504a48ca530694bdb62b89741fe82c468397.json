By creating a story that goes beyond the surface misery of the gleeful Crossed maniacs and reaching into the fragile human psyche with something truly terrifying. Todd drives a road train through the desolate Australian outback. Before C-day he was a loser, an outcast, a fat nobody with a nobody-job. Now he's an Emperor of the wasteland. His rig and its trailers are the safest place around: stocked to the brim with canned food and gasoline. But his desire to have a harem who worship him opens himself up to the true horrors of the outback. Spurrier brings his trademark flare for developing intricately flawed characters to a story that will haunt your dreams for years to come.\n\nIn a world of Crossed... there is no hope and there is no help. There is only the Crossed.\n\nPublication Date: September 18, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d200504a48ca530694bdb62b89741fe82c468397","amp;dn":"CROSSED+2013+SPECIAL+%286+Covers%29+%28Avatar%29+%28Darkness-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d200504a48ca530694bdb62b89741fe82c468397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,0,80,74,72,202,83,6,148,189,182,43,137,116,31,232,44,70,131,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
