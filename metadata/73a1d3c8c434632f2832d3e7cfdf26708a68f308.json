Sadly, Miley Cyrus is the latest example.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrager 20131008  02 Black on White Crime\n\nPrager H2: We almost never hear about black on white crime.\n The media doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it palatable. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all too common.\n\n Dennis describes a murder in Washington StateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\n A school on Long Island has banned tossing a football or cartwheels during recessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n Americans are cheating and feeling good about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrager 20131008  01 Humility\n\nPrager H1: Dennis was on the new Hannity Show. \n He was one of SeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 14 favorite guestsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n Dennis draws a contrast between Cisco, Texas where he was over the weekend\n and NYC where he is nowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n On the Hannity Show Dennis heard a very strange response to his point\n that the President has refused to open the White House to tours because he wants Americans\n to feel the sting of The SequesterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n The President wants the Washington Redskins football team to change its name.\n Of course he does.\n ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the politically correct thing to say.
