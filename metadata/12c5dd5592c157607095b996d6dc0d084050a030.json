He went on to become one of the great comedians of all time, with appeal that spans generations. His brand of provocative sociopolitical commentary and scathing comic style brought him four Grammy awards, most recently in 2002. Carlin was the first-ever host of NBC's Saturday Night Live, and has starred in twelve HBO specials. He continues to perform to sold-out audiences at venues across the country. George Carlin's sixth HBO standup concert special, &quot;What Am I Doing in New Jersey?,&quot; aired as a live broadcast from the park Theater in Union City, New Jersey. The live performance includes classic routines, &quot;Cars &amp;  Driving II,&quot; &quot;Reagan's Gang, Church People, and American Values,&quot; &quot;People I can Do Without,&quot; and &quot;Keeping People Alert.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12c5dd5592c157607095b996d6dc0d084050a030","amp;dn":"George+Carlin+-+What+am+I+Doing+in+New+Jersey+%5B1988%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12c5dd5592c157607095b996d6dc0d084050a030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,197,221,85,146,193,87,96,112,149,185,150,214,220,13,8,64,80,160,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
