It was dedicated to a friend, the Praetorian prefect Gaius Septicius Clarus, in 119. \n\nOn the Life of the Caesars was considered very significant in antiquity and remains a main source on Roman history. The book discusses the significant and critical period of the Principate from the end of the Republic to the reign of Domitian; comparisons are often made with Tacitus whose surviving works document a similar period.\n\nThis is from the Robert Graves translation.\n\nSuetonius was a gossip-monger on occasion and often relies on second-hand information, some of which is quite funny.\n\nDid you know that Nero banned mimes from Rome? Or that Augustus was afraid of lightning? \n\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b15c8b3095ee22ac96c203928102c75dc614801","amp;dn":"Suetonius+-+The+Twelve+Caesars+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b15c8b3095ee22ac96c203928102c75dc614801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,21,200,179,9,94,226,42,201,108,32,57,40,16,44,117,220,97,72,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
