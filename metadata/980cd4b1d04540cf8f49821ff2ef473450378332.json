It proceeds from the world of knots to their complementary spaces, what's not a knot. Profound theorems of mathematics show that most known complements carry the structure of hyperbolic geometry, a geometry in which the sum of three angles of a triangle always is less than 180 degrees.\n\nThe video shows the geometry of the knot complement, the space around the knot, changing into hyperbolic space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:980cd4b1d04540cf8f49821ff2ef473450378332","amp;dn":"Not+Knot%2C+topology+mathematics+knot+theory+educational+video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"980cd4b1d04540cf8f49821ff2ef473450378332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,12,212,177,208,69,64,207,143,73,130,31,242,239,71,52,80,55,131,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
