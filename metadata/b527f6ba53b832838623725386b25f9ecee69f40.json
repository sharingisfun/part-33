The 1976 compilation captured\nthe darkest and beefiest moments from the Ozzy years and served\nas a right of passage for millions of aspiring musicians\nburnouts, pastor's kids, and closet miscreants. Rhino's 16-track\nGreatest Hits 1970-1978 anthology only trumps the single-disc We\nSold Our Soul CD by two songs, but it offers superior sound and\nfeatures at least a few cuts from 1976's Technical Ecstasy and\n1978's Never Say Die!, the band's last two pre-millennium Ozzy\nrecords. All of the faves are here (&quot;Paranoid,&quot; &quot;War Pigs,&quot; &quot;Iron\nMan&quot;), as well as fan classics like &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and\n&quot;Supernaut,&quot; but there is enough material missing to call it a\nsampler rather than a &quot;best of.&quot; Fans who are unwilling to shell\nout the extra money for Sanctuary's superior two-disc Sabbath\ncollection from 2005 will find this sparse yet solid overview to\nbe a useful &quot;CliffsNotes&quot; rendering of the birth of heavy metal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b527f6ba53b832838623725386b25f9ecee69f40","amp;dn":"Black_Sabbath-Greatest_Hits_1970-1978-CD-FLAC-2006-FORSAKEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b527f6ba53b832838623725386b25f9ecee69f40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,39,246,186,83,184,50,131,134,35,114,83,134,178,95,158,206,230,159,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
