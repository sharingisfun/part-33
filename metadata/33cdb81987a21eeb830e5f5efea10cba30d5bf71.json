He decides that he wants to make peace with his family and have one last reunion. He confides this information to his estranged wife Kate Thornton (Maureen Stapleton). But when his doctor says that it won't be good for him to travel, she suggests that he call his four adult children and invite them all for Christmas. He agrees only with the provision that they not be told of his illness and imminent death. The only problem is that most of his family are not exactly fond of him because he walked out on his wife and because of his stubborn nature. Of his four children, Adam is most nervous about seeing Bud Thornton (Gregory Harrison) whom he hasn't spoken to since having an argument regarding the Vietnam War and his moving to Canada, several years prior.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33cdb81987a21eeb830e5f5efea10cba30d5bf71","amp;dn":"The+Gathering+1977+Ed+Asner+Christmas+Movie+DVDRip+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33cdb81987a21eeb830e5f5efea10cba30d5bf71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,205,184,25,135,162,30,235,131,14,95,94,254,161,12,186,48,213,191,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
