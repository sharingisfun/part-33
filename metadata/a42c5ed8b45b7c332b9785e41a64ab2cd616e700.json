In 2011, they released their debut album titled Headbangers In Ecstasy on Mexican Summer, an independent record label based out of Brooklyn, NY, and shortly after, released the album in Europe and the rest of the world via Record Makers. Following the release, the sisters toured North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan with artists like Ariel Pink s Haunted Graffiti and John Maus.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s brilliant, bright, and distinct. The clouds have parted and youâ€™re going to like what you see. â€“Pitchfork\r\n\r\nThe lush, shimmery lead single Tell Me hints at these shadowy themes, as the subtle groove is on some classy, almost quiet-storm-y 80s vibes, while Piper s haunting dusky vocals extend a fiery, breathless plea to a prospective lover. It s an intoxicating and sweetly seductive slow burn that feels like a major step forward for the group. â€“Gorilla vs. Bear\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Panarchy 3:56\r\n02. Peccavi 4:09\r\n03.
