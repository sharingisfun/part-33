Terror gripped it, too. They found four corpses in four days, each more hideous than the last.\n\nStrange nights....\nAt first the cops thought they were dealing with a psychopath. But soon they heard eerie sounds in the ventilation system - and saw unearthly silver eyes in the snow-slashed night.\n\nFinal hours....\nIn a city paralyzed by a blizzard, something watches, something stalks.
