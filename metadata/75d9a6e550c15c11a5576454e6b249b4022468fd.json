S. Elnashaie (Springer, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-981-287-495-5\r\n\r\nThe book describes the basic principles of transforming nano-technology into nano-engineering with a particular focus on chemical engineering fundamentals. This book provides vital information about differences between descriptive technology and quantitative engineering for students as well as working professionals in various fields of nanotechnology. Besides chemical engineering principles, the fundamentals of nanotechnology are also covered along with detailed explanation of several specific nanoscale processes from chemical engineering point of view. This information is presented in form of practical examples and case studies that help the engineers and researchers to integrate the processes which can meet the commercial production. It is worth mentioning here that, the main challenge in nanostructure and nanodevices production is nowadays related to the economic point of view.\r\n\r\nThe uniqueness of this book is a balance between important insights into the synthetic methods of nano-structures and nanomaterials and their applications with chemical engineering rules that educates the readers about nanosclale process design, simulation, modelling and optimization. Briefly, the book takes the readers through a journey from fundamentals to frontiers of engineering of nanoscale processes and informs them about industrial perspective research challenges, opportunities and synergism in chemical Engineering and nanotechnology. Utilising this information the readers can make informed decisions on their career and business","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d9a6e550c15c11a5576454e6b249b4022468fd","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+for+Chemical+Engineers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d9a6e550c15c11a5576454e6b249b4022468fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,217,166,229,80,193,92,17,165,87,100,84,230,178,73,180,2,36,104,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
