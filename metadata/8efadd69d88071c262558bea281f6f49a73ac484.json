Thanks to our friend &quot;M&quot; for the 2nd gen.\n\nHere's the story in regards to why this show is incomplete. Two 120 minutes tapes were brought to record this show. One was with the recorder (which was w/Nicky-Artie's friend for the majority of the show) and one with Artie who ended up near the stage wearing a t-shirt that said &quot;staff&quot; or &quot;security&quot;. Security discovered this and\nbringing Artie back to the security office. Artie had the other 120 minute tape on him.\nThe band:\n\nRobert Plant-Vocals\nJimmy Page-Guitar\nJohn Bonham-Drums\nJohn Paul Jones-Bass, Mandolin, Organ\n\nIF YOU SHARE THIS ELSE WHERE PLEASE KEEP ALL THE INFO INTACT\nIT SUCKS TO DOWNLOAD SOMETHING TWICE AND NOT GIVE CREDIT TO\nTHE UPLOADER/SOURCE......AS ALWAYS ENJOY.CHEERS KRW_CO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8efadd69d88071c262558bea281f6f49a73ac484","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1972-06-15+-+Nassau+Coliseum%2C+Uniondale%2C+NY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8efadd69d88071c262558bea281f6f49a73ac484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,250,221,105,216,128,113,194,98,85,139,234,40,31,111,73,167,58,196,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
