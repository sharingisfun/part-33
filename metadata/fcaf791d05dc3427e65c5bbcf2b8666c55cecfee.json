Renowned Lithuanian documentarist Audrius Stonys took these words as a motto for his latest film, a meditative visual essay which portrays old people undertaking all kinds of activities, meditation and group laughter therapy. Without a single word of commentary, he creates from sophisticated, aesthetic images a compelling study of human corporeality which, in an ideal union with spiritual equilibrium, can sustain us with the pledge that old age doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be a painful wait for the last breath.\n\n-http://www.kviff.com/en/films/film-archive-detail/20071780-uku-ukai/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcaf791d05dc3427e65c5bbcf2b8666c55cecfee","amp;dn":"Uku+ukai+%282006%29+-+Audrionys+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcaf791d05dc3427e65c5bbcf2b8666c55cecfee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,175,121,29,5,220,52,39,230,92,91,188,242,184,102,108,85,206,207,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
