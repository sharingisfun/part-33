Upon waking, he hurried to a piano and played the tune to avoid forgetting it.  McCartney is the only Beatle to appear on the recording, and it was the first official recording by the Beatles that relied upon a performance by a single member of the band. He was accompanied by a string quartet. The final recording was so different from other works by the Beatles that the band members vetoed the release of the song as a single in the United Kingdom.  In 2000 McCartney asked Yoko Ono if she would agree to change the credit on the song to read &quot;McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â€œLennon&quot; in the The Beatles Anthology, but she refused.\n         At the time of its first appearance the song was released by the Beatles' record company as a single in the United States but not in the United Kingdom. Consequently, whilst it topped the American chart in 1965 the song first hit the British top 10 three months after the release of Help! in a cover version by Matt Monro. &quot;Yesterday&quot; was voted the best song of the 20th century in a 1999 BBC Radio 2 poll of music experts and listeners and was also voted the No. 1 Pop song of all time by MTV and Rolling Stone magazine the following year. In 1997, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI) asserts that it was performed over seven million times in the 20th century alone.\n\n         &quot;Hope of Deliverance&quot; is a hit song by Paul McCartney, featured on his 1993 album &quot;Off the Ground&quot;. It became a hit in his native UK, reaching number 18. It did not fare well on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 83, but did better on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, hitting number 9. It also did very well in Germany, reaching number 3 there, and is still gaining a lot of airplay in Central and Eastern European radios as well as in South America. Remix versions were released on 15 January 1993, and picked up massive airplay in clubs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b5b7451153e16d9d59a93d6f960d93ad3e10199","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+511","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b5b7451153e16d9d59a93d6f960d93ad3e10199","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,91,116,81,21,62,22,217,213,154,147,214,249,96,217,58,211,225,1,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
