Bloch (Fairmont, 2000).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0-88173-296-6\r\n\r\nRetired reliability engineer Bloch assembles a wide array of data and ideas for mechanics, machinists, and lubrications specialists as well as his own colleagues, to help them understand what matters most in a lubricant and distinguish mere sales talk from relevant facts. He discusses such topics as the principles of lubrication; general purpose oils to inhibit rust and oxidation; hydraulic fluids; environmentally friendly, synthetic, and forest-product and paper machine lubricants; lubricating greases; pastes; waxes; tribosystems; oil mist lubrication systems; bearings; and handling and analyzing lubricants. He includes a glossary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97831953671467e09ade27c638f47ed0b71ab56f","amp;dn":"Practical+Lubrication+for+Industrial+Facilities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97831953671467e09ade27c638f47ed0b71ab56f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,131,25,83,103,20,103,224,154,222,39,198,56,244,126,208,183,26,181,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
