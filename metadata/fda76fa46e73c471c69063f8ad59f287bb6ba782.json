Recruiting the long-forgotten likes of singer Ibrahim Ferrer, guitarists/singers Compay Segundo and Eliades Ochoa, and pianist RubÃƒÂ©n GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Cooder entered Havana's Egrem Studios to record the album Buena Vista Social Club; the project was an unexpected commercial and critical smash, earning a Grammy and becoming the best-selling release of Cooder's long career. In 1998 he returned to Havana with his son, percussionist Joachim, to record a solo LP with Ferrer; the sessions were captured on film by director Wim Wenders, who also documented sell-out Buena Vista Social Club live performances in Amsterdam and New York City. (Wenders' film, also titled Buena Vista Social Club, earned an Academy Award nomination in 2000.) The public's continued interest in Cuban music subsequently generated solo efforts from Segundo and GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, as well as a series of international live performances promoted under the Buena Vista Social Club aegis. A concert CD, At Carnegie Hall, drawn from the same triumphant show that Wenders featured in his documentary, was released in 2008 -- a few years after the deaths of Segundo, Ferrer, and GonzÃƒÂ¡lez. In the spring of 2015, Nonesuch/World Circuit released Lost and Found, a collection of unreleased tracks from the 1996 Egrem and 2000 recording sessions, as well as live tracks. A group containing some of the original members called Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club continued to tour, and their farewell tour took place that year. \n\n\nGenre................: Latin Jazz (Cuba)\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Egrem Music\nIncluded.............:Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1 - Eliades Ochoa\n\nCuban vocalist and guitarist Eliades Ochoa worked with many groups during his career, including the Septetos Cubanos, Casa de la Troya, and Cuarteto Patria, with which he recorded two albums, 1993's A Una Coqueta and 1998's Cubafrica. Ochoa's work on Ry Cooder's Buena Vista Social Club raised his mainstream prominence; on his second solo album, 1999's Sublime Illusion, Ochoa collaborated with Cooder and Cuarteto Patria once again. Other releases include Son de Santiago and Cuarteto Patria. Fall 2000 saw the release of Eliades Ochoa y el Cuarteto Patria and Cuidadito Compay Gallo was issued a year later. The earthy and gruff Estoy Como Nunca followed a year later. \n\n01.El Cuarto De Tula\n02.Estoy Hecho Tierra\n03.En Casa De Pedro El Cojo\n04.Alli Donde Tu Sabes\n05.La Culebra\n06.Rita La Caimana\n07.Que Lio Compay AndrÃƒÂ©s\n08.Alma De Mujer\n09.Mujer Perjura\n10.Que Te Parece Cholito\n11.La Comadre Catalina\n12.La Venganza Del Perico\n13.Entre Flores\n14.Beso Discreto\n\n\nCD2 - Compay Segundo\n\nLegendary Cuban guitarist Compay Segundo was born in 1907; collaborating with the likes of Sindo Garay, Miguel\nMatamoros and Benny MorÃƒÂ©, he emerged as one of the most respected musicians of the pre-revolution era, and in the late '20s invented the armÃƒÂ³nico, a guitar customized with a double third string to fuse the tonal qualities of the traditional Cuban tres guitar and its Spanish counterpart. Following Fidel Castro's rise to power, Segundo worked as a cigar roller before returning to music during the late '80s; in his early nineties he attracted worldwide attention in 1998 for his contributions to Ry Cooder's wildly successful Buena Vista Social Club album, issuing the solo Calle Salud the following year. Buena Vista Connection was issued in fall 2000. Flores de la Vida followed later that same year; Trova Cubana surfaced in early 2001. The torrent of releases, both new and reissues of classic pre-fame Segundo sessions, continued throughout 2001 with Yo Vengo Aqui, Que Lio Compay Andres and into 2002 with Yo Soy del Monte and Dos Leyendas de Cuba. On July 13 of the following year Compay Segundo died of kidney failure at his home in Havana.\n\n01.Saludos Compay\n02.Chan Chan\n03.Voy Pa' Mayari\n04.Anita\n05.La Mujer Del Peso\n06.Sanluisera\n07.Yo Soy Del Monte Compay\n08.SerÃƒÂ¡ Cuando TÃƒÂº Digas\n09.Francisco Guayabal\n10.Sigue El Paso No. 1\n11.A Los Barrios De Santiago\n12.De Jatibonico A Bolondron\n13.Sigue El Paso No. 2\n14.Sigue El Paso En La Nochebuena\n15.MarÃƒÂ­a En La Playa\n\n\nCD3 - Ibrahim Ferrer\n\nWith the release of the Grammy-winning album Buena Vista Social Club and an acclaimed documentary of the same name, Cuban singer Ibrahim Ferrer vaulted from obscurity and poverty to international fame in the twilight of his life. He was born February 20, 1927, when his mother went into labor during a dance in the Cuban village of San Luis. By 12, Ferrer was an orphan, surviving by selling newspapers and produce on the street. He began his professional singing career at 14, joining his cousin's vocal group Los Jovenes del Son -- Ferrer later sang with acts including Conjunto Sorpresa, Maravilla de BeltrÃƒÂ¡n, Beny MorÃƒÂ©, and Electo Rosell's jazz group La Orquesta ChepÃƒÂ­n ChovÃƒÂ©n, with whom he scored the 1955 regional hit &quot;El Platanal de Bartolo.&quot; He also sang with Pacho Alonso, whose Santiago-based group Los Bocucos relocated to Havana in 1959 in the wake of the Cuban Revolution -- Ferrer served with Alonso on and off for over three decades, during that time proving himself not only a master of the energetic, uptempo guarachas and sones but also a sublime bolero singer with an uncommon sense of space and silence. \n\n01.El Botellero\n02.Como La Piel Canela\n03.Fomento\n04.Monte Adentro\n05.En Que Parte De Cuba Nacio El Son\n06.Asi Es La Vida Compay\n07.Todavia Me Queda Voz\n08.El Son De La Santiaguera\n09.Cucuruchito De Coco\n10.Esto Se Baila Y Se Toca\n11.Ahora No Puedo\n12.Mi Tonada Montuna\n13.Estoy Seco Y Me Quiero Mojar\n14.MaÃƒÂ±ana Me Voy Pa' SibanicÃƒÂº\n15.El Platanal De Bartolo\n\n\nCD4 - Omara Portuondo\n\nOmara Portuonda is the grand old lady of Cuban music. While her early recordings made her a star in Cuba, her participation in the 1996 album and video documentary, The Buena Vista Social Club, brought her to international attention. Her solo album, The Buena Vista Social Club Presents Omara Portuondo, released in 2000, reinforced her status as one of Cuba's greatest musical ambassadors. A native of Havana, Portuondo was one of three daughters born to a baseball player on the Cuban national team and a woman of Spanish heritage who left the comfort and support of her wealthy family home to marry the man she loved. Her parents' singing provided the soundtrack for her early life. As a youngster, she sang in school choirs and music classes. \n\n01.Ãƒâ€°chale Salsita\n02.Lo Que Me Queda Por Vivir\n03.Mi Son Caliente\n04.Vuela Pena\n05.Guitarra En Son Mayor\n06.Nada Para Ti\n07.Vieja Luna\n08.Te Queria\n09.Vale La Pena Vivir\n10.Toda Una Vida\n11.Eso No Lo He Dicho Yo\n12.Me Acostumbre A Estar Sin Ti\n13.Y Mucho MÃƒÂ¡s\n14.Nosotros\n15.Agua Que Cae Del Cielo\n\n\nCD5 - RubÃƒÂ©n GonzÃƒÂ¡lez\n\nRubÃƒÂ©n GonzÃƒÂ¡lez was one of the last of Cuba's great Afro-Cuban piano players. Although he had played and recorded with the band led by Enrique JorrÃƒÂ­n, the creator of the cha-cha, for a quarter of a century, he had retired from music by the mid-'80s. Things began to change when GonzÃƒÂ¡lez recorded with the Afro-Cuban All Stars in 1996. The album, A Toda Cuba Le Gusta, released the following year, helped to inspire an international fascination for Afro-Cuban music and brought GonzÃƒÂ¡lez to the attention of a global audience. His performance on the Ry Cooder-produced album Buena Vista Social Club made him an international phenomenon. Signing a contract with Cooder's label, World Circuit, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez released his debut solo album, Introducing...Ruben Gonzalez, at the age of 78.\n\n01.Yo Te EnseÃƒÂ±o Lola\n02.Soplete\n03.PrÃƒÂ©stame La Bicicleta\n04.Date Una Vueltecita\n05.Ambrosio\n06.La Gloria Eres Tu\n07.Noneto\n08.Nuestra CanciÃƒÂ³n\n09.Moby Dick\n10.Todo Aquel Ayer\n11.Ã‚Â¿De Que Te Quejas?\n12.Mil Congojas\n13.Sancho\n14.Cuidad Oscura\n15.Que Infelicidad\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fda76fa46e73c471c69063f8ad59f287bb6ba782","amp;dn":"Buena+Vista+Social+Club+Original+De+Cuba+5+Leyendas+%282005%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fda76fa46e73c471c69063f8ad59f287bb6ba782","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,167,111,164,110,115,196,113,198,144,99,248,173,89,242,135,187,107,167,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
