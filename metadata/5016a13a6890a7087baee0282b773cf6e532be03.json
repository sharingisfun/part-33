E82, E87, E88)\n3er 3 Series (E90, E91, E92, E93)\n5er 5 Series (E60, E61)\n6er 6 Series (E63, E64)\nX5 (E70)\nX6 (E71)\n\nProfessional Navigation system looks like this: http://www.navigationau.com/images/stories/Navigation_retrofit/equipment_navigation.jpg\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Download\n2. Burn to a CD NOT DVD. The original disc was a CD. I guess 400mb of data didn't justify a DVD\n3. Eject the disc in your car and swap it over\n\nI've burnt a copy and tested, it works for me.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5016a13a6890a7087baee0282b773cf6e532be03","amp;dn":"BMW+GPS+Navigation+DVD+Australia+v14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5016a13a6890a7087baee0282b773cf6e532be03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,22,161,58,104,144,167,8,123,174,224,40,43,119,60,246,229,50,190,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
