Originally inspired by Federici's organizational work in the Wages for Housework movement, the topics discussed include the international restructuring of reproductive work and its effects on the sexual division of labor, the globalization of care work and sex work, the crisis of elder care, and the development of affective labor. Both a brief history of the international feminist movement and a contemporary critique of capitalism, these writings continue the investigation of the economic roots of violence against women.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e8dd07c035c2ccbaf431be4de23166c38c80e4","amp;dn":"Revolution+at+Point+Zero%2C+Housework%2C+Reproduction%2C+and+Feminist+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e8dd07c035c2ccbaf431be4de23166c38c80e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,232,221,7,192,53,194,204,186,244,49,190,77,226,49,102,195,140,128,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
