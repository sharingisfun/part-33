Naming themselves for their very favorite moment of a Melvins song, 2:54 bring that same sense of specificity to their songwriting, crafting songs that, while textured and dramatic, still feel very concise. 2:54 aren't delving into the kind of wild-eyed, mind-boggling sound blasts that My Bloody Valentine destroyed eardrums and melted minds with, but are instead following more in the tradition of Lush with a sound that feels more compact. This tight structure gives the band an almost motorik quality, with songs like &quot;Easy Undercover&quot; and &quot;Watcher&quot; feeling like shoegaze filtered through Queens of the Stone Age's early &quot;robot rock&quot; period, giving the songs a metronomic element that is constantly pushing things forward amidst the waves of lazy, shimmering guitars and haunting vocals. This kind of drifting momentum makes 2:54 a lot like taking a trip on a train, allowing listeners to simply sit back and enjoy the scenery without needing to think too much about how they're getting from one end of the journey to the other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81f9c8a5528d9705fa2b2e16150bf41efbcfd28","amp;dn":"2.54+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81f9c8a5528d9705fa2b2e16150bf41efbcfd28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,31,156,138,85,40,217,112,95,162,178,225,97,80,191,65,239,188,253,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
