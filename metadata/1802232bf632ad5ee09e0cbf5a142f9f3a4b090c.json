If there are any problems or if anything is different with this video leave a comment. Not 100% sure I've got everything right. I watched it though and it all seemed right.\n\n\nSTOSSEL'S TAKE\n--------------\nNO MEANS...TRY AGAIN? What is sexual consent? Now we're told &quot;affirmative consent&quot; must be &quot;enthusiastic&quot; and ongoing. That's the language from a new California law, and it is policy at many universities. But this is nonsense. Men and women Stossel interviewed often admitted that many women want to play &quot;hard to get.&quot;\n\nMATTRESS GIRL: Columbia student Emma Sulkowicz says another student raped her, but Columbia did nothing about it. For months she's carried the mattress she was allegedly raped on everywhere to raise awareness over the school's failure to expel the boy. A Columbia judicial board has heard the case twice and both times ruled the boy innocent.\n\nNO MEANS...TRY AGAIN? What is sexual consent?

While our contract was a joke, others are deadly serious about it. Some promote a new app, Good2Go, which says this: &quot;When you are ready to ask a partner they consent to sexual activity, just launch the app and provide the phone to your partner.\n\n&quot;Your partner is presented with the question, &quot;Are you good to go?&quot; and three choices. If the partner chooses &quot;I'm good to go,&quot; then they also assess the sobriety level. If the partner chooses &quot;pretty wasted,&quot; the selection changes to &quot;no thanks.&quot;\n\nKIDS DOING IT YOUNGER: Contrary to what the media say, kids are not doing it younger. The age of first sexual activity is later than it's been, and teen pregnancy rate is the lowest it's been in decades.\n\nIS PORN IMMORAL? People I interviewed in Times Square said it is, but adult film actress and Duke Sophomore Belle Knox says: No! Porn is perfectly healthy.\n\nREAL OR FAKE? Some states have really bizarre sex laws-so bizarre, you wouldn't believe they were real. Stossel quizzes &quot;The Independents&quot; hosts Kennedy, Matt Welch, and Kmele Foster to see if they can tell which laws are real and which ones were made up by John's staff.\n\nFor instance:\n\nIn Massachusetts...\n\nSex between unmarried individuals is illegal.\n\nYou can play along!\n\n\nINFO:\n-----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio. File size limited to 350MB. (310 video 40 audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : Stossel.2014.11.13.Sex.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nOverall bit rate : 1 193 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d49cbdb3bc9498e7fae4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nBit rate : 1 054 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 6s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1802232bf632ad5ee09e0cbf5a142f9f3a4b090c","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.11.13.Sex.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1802232bf632ad5ee09e0cbf5a142f9f3a4b090c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,2,35,43,246,50,173,94,224,158,12,191,90,20,47,159,58,75,9,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
