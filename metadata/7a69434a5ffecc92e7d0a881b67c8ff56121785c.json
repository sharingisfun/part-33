GRIN developed an arcade version of the game, released in 2002 featuring a unique reclined seating position cabinet by Triotech Amusement. Players race across seven different tracks in various leagues against other competitors on high-speed hoverbikes.[1]\n\nThe game was GRIN&amp;#039;s first to be released, and featured the first version of their Diesel game engine; later versions of the engine were used to power other GRIN games such as the Windows version of Tom Clancy&amp;#039;s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.[2] GRIN worked closely with NVIDIA to incorporate then new technologies into the game, and was marketed as one of the flagship titles for the GeForce 3 Series of graphics cards.[3]\n\nCritical reaction was generally favourable, with reviewers being impressed by the beauty of the graphics and the thrilling depiction of speed. They were however, slightly disappointed with the shallow nature of the gameplay.[4] A newer version of the arcade game was released in 2003, incorporating motion simulator technology into the arcade cabinet.[5]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics_(video_game)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistics_(video_game)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a69434a5ffecc92e7d0a881b67c8ff56121785c","amp;dn":"Ballistics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a69434a5ffecc92e7d0a881b67c8ff56121785c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,105,67,74,95,254,204,146,231,208,168,129,182,124,143,245,97,33,120,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
