This is the Striking Series, there is also the Nuclear Weapons series which involves, knives, handguns, etc and lastly ther is the Joint Breaking series.\nThis is originally from Demonoid. I am looking for the Joint Breaking series that was also uploaded to the dearly departed Demonoid.\n\n&quot;his system is comprised of all finishing shots. You will learn how to severely injure and/or kill someone with this information. Tim and his buddies teach you to zero in on the most vulnerable areas of the human body. I would recommend buying a SCARS combat strike chart too. Please do not be an imbecile and use these techniques while fighting over a parking space at your local walmart. \n\nFor those of you who don&amp;#039;t know about Tim Larkin read his bio at http://www.targetfocustraining.com/bio.html \n\nHe is also a former master instructor of the S.C.A.R.S. system at Jerry Peterson&amp;#039;s Direct Action Corporation. \nAs far as I know, Target Focus Training is a direct spin off of S.C.A.R.S. \nI purchased Tim&amp;#039;s System because I didn&amp;#039;t want to buy the SCARS packages without knowing what I could expect to see. \n\nFor more information about SCARS see the following links: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scars.com/SCARS/_scars/scars_hist.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scars.com/SCARS/_scars/scars_hist.jsp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scars.com/SCARS/_scars/scarswarn.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scars.com/SCARS/_scars/scarswarn.jsp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scars.com/SCARS/dacMain.jsp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scars.com/SCARS/dacMain.jsp&lt;/a&gt;  &quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff8d85f66374d4afa0b8f0a1f02da2dae2b9d5f","amp;dn":"TFT+Target+Focus+Training+-+Striking%2C+Combat%2C+AGI%2C+Martial+Arts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff8d85f66374d4afa0b8f0a1f02da2dae2b9d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,248,216,95,102,55,77,74,250,11,143,10,31,2,218,45,174,43,157,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
