He demonstrates why todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conflicts must be understood as intertwined political and military events, and makes clear why the current model of total war has failed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other recent campaigns. Smith offers a compelling contemporary vision for how to secure our world and the consequences of ignoring the new, shifting face of war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e55fdc80af4451b9b013c7f5a58ac92b881467c","amp;dn":"The+Utility+of+Force%3A+The+Art+of+War+in+the+Modern+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e55fdc80af4451b9b013c7f5a58ac92b881467c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,85,253,200,10,244,69,27,155,1,60,127,90,88,172,146,184,129,70,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
