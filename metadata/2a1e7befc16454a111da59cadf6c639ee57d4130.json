The auto-snapshot feature means you won't have to keep awkwardly trying to position your camera.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This app is designed for reading regular Chinese text (like in a book). It is NOT intended for reading things like shop signs, food labels or other images using stylized text, so please bear this in mind before purchasing.\n\nIf you encounter any problems, please contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bcd4ddd2ccd5d2dbfcd9d1ded9ced1d5c8ced992dfd3d1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and we will do our very best to fix it. We have done lots of testing on many different devices but there may be some problematic camera drivers we have not yet come across.\n\nIf you're not satisfied, for any reason, within 30 days you get a full refund, period, no questions asked. We don't want your money if you're not amazingly happy.\n\nMain features:\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Designed for students learning Chinese\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Scans live camera preview as well as still images (such as photos)\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Works entirely offline!
