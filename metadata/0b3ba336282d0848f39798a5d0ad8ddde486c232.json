Real estate and renovation experts, Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott, come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple has to decide between two big renovation projects so the brothers' design equally tantalizing plans for both. One favours Steve's top-of-the-line kitchen fantasy, while the other caters to Marianne's vision of a master bedroom retreat. The couple makes a tough decision but from the first hammer swing, disaster strikes and everyone worries that the ultimate dream renovation has become the ultimate nightmare.\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b3ba336282d0848f39798a5d0ad8ddde486c232","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e08.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b3ba336282d0848f39798a5d0ad8ddde486c232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,59,163,54,40,45,8,72,243,151,152,165,208,173,141,221,228,134,194,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
