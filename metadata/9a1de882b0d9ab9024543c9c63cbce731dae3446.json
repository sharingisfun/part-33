How do I know this? Because Obama says so himself. Reflect for a moment on the title of his book: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not Dreams of My Father but rather Dreams from My Father. In other words, Obama is not writing a book about his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams; he is writing a book about the dreams that he got from his father.\n\nThink about what this means. The most powerful country in the world is being governed according to the dreams of a Luo tribesman of the 1950sÃ¢â‚¬â€a polygamist who abandoned his wives, drank himself into stupors, and bounced around on two iron legs (after his real legs had to be amputated because of a car crash caused by his drunk driving). This philandering, inebriated African socialist, who raged against the world for denying him the realization of his anti-colonial ambitions, is now setting the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agenda through the reincarnation of his dreams in his son. The son is the one who is making it happen, but the son is, as he candidly admits, only living out his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream. The invisible father provides the inspiration, and the son dutifully gets the job done. America today is being governed by a ghost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a1de882b0d9ab9024543c9c63cbce731dae3446","amp;dn":"%5B2010%5D+The+Roots+of+Obama%27s+Rage.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a1de882b0d9ab9024543c9c63cbce731dae3446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,29,232,130,176,217,171,144,36,84,60,156,99,203,206,115,29,174,52,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
