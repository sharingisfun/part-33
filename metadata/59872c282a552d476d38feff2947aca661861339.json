Ostatni etap) was a 1947 Polish feature film directed and co-written by Wanda Jakubowska, depicting her experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. The film was one of the earliest cinematic efforts to describe the Holocaust, and it is still quoted extensively by succeeding directors, including Steven Spielberg in Schindler's List.\n\nSee also: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_stage/\n\n\nIt took my personally a lot of time to find this movie, so I want to share it. Please download/share it with as many people as possible. May Auschwitz, its victims and its perpetrators crimes against humanity never be forgotten.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59872c282a552d476d38feff2947aca661861339","amp;dn":"++Ostatni+Etap+%28The+Last+Stage%29-+Poland+1947-Must+see","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59872c282a552d476d38feff2947aca661861339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,135,44,40,42,85,45,71,109,56,254,255,41,71,172,166,97,134,19,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
