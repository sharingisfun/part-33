Since he was in Ray Charles' band at the time, Newman was able to use Charles on piano along with Hank Crawford (here called &amp;quot;Bennie Crawford&amp;quot;) on baritone, trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, bassist Edgar Willis, and drummer Milt Turner. The music is essentially soulful bebop, with the highlights including &amp;quot;Hard Times,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Fathead,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Mean to Me,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tin Tin Deo.&amp;quot; Everyone plays well and this was a fine start to David &amp;quot;Fathead&amp;quot; Newman's career. This historic set was issued on CD by Collectables in 2005.\n\nTracks\n\t\t1 \t \tHard Times \tMitchell \t4:43\n  \t  \t2 \t \tWeird Beard \tCrawford \t4:49\n  \t  \t3 \t\tWillow Weep for Me \tRonell \t4:59\n  \t  \t4 \tBill for Bennie \tCrawford \t4:17\n  \t  \t5 \t\tSweet Eyes \tCrawford \t3:45\n  \t6 \tFathead \tNewman \t5:23\n  \t  \t7 \t \tMean to Me \tAhlert, Turk \t4:16\n  \t \t8 \t \tTin Tin Deo \tPozo \t5:20","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e679061e1097d77699db137a3c3c3268d009ce1e","amp;dn":"JAZZ-+David+%5C%22Fathead%5C%22+Newman+-+Ray+Charles+Presents+David+Ne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e679061e1097d77699db137a3c3c3268d009ce1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,121,6,30,16,151,215,118,153,219,19,122,60,60,50,104,208,9,206,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
