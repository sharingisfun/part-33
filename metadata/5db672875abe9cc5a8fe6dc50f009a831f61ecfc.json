It reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's only top 40 single.\n\n&quot;Cantaloop&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on March 25, 1994 for sales of over 500,000 copies.\n\nThe song makes notable mention of the Birdland jazz club in New York City in its opening line Ã¢â‚¬â€œ &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we have something special down here at Birdland this evening: a recording for Blue Note Records.&quot; The line, spoken by Pee Wee Marquette, is taken from Art Blakey's first Birdland album A Night at Birdland Vol. 1.\n\nThere are recurring samples, particularly in the beginning, of two men saying &quot;yeah!&quot; and &quot;what's that?&quot;. Both of these were taken from the intro to Lou Donaldson's &quot;Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky (From Now On)&quot;\n\nUs3 is a jazz-rap group founded in London in 1992. Their name was inspired by a Horace Parlan recording produced by Alfred Lion, the founder of Blue Note Records. On their debut album, Hand on the Torch, Us3 exclusively used samples from the Blue Note Records catalogue, all originally produced by Lion.\n\nUs3 is the brainchild of London-based producer Geoff Wilkinson. Formed in 1992 alongside production partner Mel Simpson, Us3 had two previous incarnations. The first, a limited edition white label 12&quot; release in 1990 called &quot;Where Will We Be In The 21st Century&quot;. The release garnered the attention of independent label Ninja Tune, resulting in NW1's 1991 12&quot; &quot;The Band Played The Boogie&quot; featuring UK Rapper Born 2 B. It sampled a dancefloor tune of the burgeoning jazz dance scene, Grant Green's &quot;Sookie Sookie&quot;, originally released on Blue Note Records.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantaloop_(Flip_Fantasia)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantaloop_(Flip_Fantasia)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HakEGAAfN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HakEGAAfN&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 7700kbps\n   Audio1: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bit]\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:42\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
