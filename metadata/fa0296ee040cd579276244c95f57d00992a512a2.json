After \ngraduating he went to work in a London department store; one of his \nco-workers there was under contract with CBS, and soon O'Sullivan was \nsigned to the label as well. Early singles like &quot;What Can I Do?&quot; and &quot;Mr. \nMoody's Garden&quot; were released to little attention, however, and so O'Sullivan \nsent his demo to impresario Gordon Mills, whose MAM label was home to \nsuperstars like Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck; the gambit worked, \nand his first single for MAM, &quot;Nothing Rhymed,&quot; became a Top Ten U.K. hit in \nlate 1970. \n\nArtist...............: Gilbert O'Sullivan\nAlbum................: Caricature: The Box\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD {Rhino Handmade/Warner RHM2 7849}\nYear.................: 2004\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 61 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: Numbered Limited Edition 2213/2500\n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 2/19/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: LOG, CUE, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n                           CD1\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           \n\n   1.
