Highlights include renditions of Django Reinhardt's &quot;Manoir de Mes Reves,&quot; Johnny Mandel's &quot;Barbara's Theme&quot; and George Russell's &quot;All About Rosie. &quot; ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide\n\nGerry Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band was one of the great bands of the early 1960s - of all time, really.  Mulligan, whose big band (and small big band) experience went back to Gene Krupa and the Miles Davis Birth of the Cool recordings, expanded and enlarged on the sound of his quartet, sextet, and tentets in the Concert Jazz Band.  This album contains a dozen cuts from the four albums the band made for Verve between 1960 and late 1962.  (There are several other excellent CDs currently available, from the band's European tour in late 1960 and from an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival earlier that year. )\nHighlights of this collection include Al Cohn's wonderful sax section writing on &quot;Lady Chatterley's Mother,&quot; the interplay between Mulligan and Clark Terry on the definitive &quot;Blueport,&quot; and George Russell's arrangement of &quot;All About Rosie. &quot; In addition to Mulligan (who plays piano on &quot;Chuggin'&quot; - he's a wonderful piano player - and clarinet on &quot;Big City Blues&quot; ) and Terry, soloists include Bob Brookmeyer (valve trombone and piano), Don Ferrara on trumpet, and Jim Reider on tenor.  Mel Lewis is the drummer who makes it all happen, on all but the final recording date.  That one, released as &quot;Gerry Mulligan 1963&quot; (although recorded in December 1962), presents a band with a somewhat different, perhaps more arranged, sound, but it includes Jim Hall on guitar. \n\nIf you can find a copy of the now-discontinued Verve Compact Jazz CD of the Concert Jazz Band, you'll have a pretty complete representation of the band's official recordings.  The older collection includes three cuts that are sadly missing from this one: Zoot Sims' great solos on &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; and &quot;Apple Core,&quot; and Mulligan's delightful piano outing on &quot;Let My People Be. &quot;\n\nThis is a great band.
