Nobody wants the prize more than young Charlie, but as his family is so poor that buying even one bar of chocolate is a treat, buying enough bars to find one of the five golden tickets is unlikely in the extreme. But in movieland, magic can happen. Charlie, along with four somewhat odious other children, get the chance of a lifetime and a tour of the factory. Along the way, mild disasters befall each of the odious children, but can Charlie beat the odds and grab the brass ring?\n\n\nBurn ISO to your DVD media watch in your DVD player, or Computer.\n\n(You can mount The iso to, to play on your computer).\n\n\nYou may need to booktype dvd+r type to dvd-rom thru\nyour burn software if your dvd player or computer as trouble \nplaying any dvd+R type.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you write a comment let us know.\n\n\n\nPlease Support This Torrent, Seed and Enjoy!\n\n(I may not have a backup of this later, you'll need to seed this)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a5852f90de4c92347664a6c55c74661d4b35bf7","amp;dn":"Willy+Wonka+%26amp%3B+The+Chocolate+Factory+%281971%29+%5BDVD5+-+NTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a5852f90de4c92347664a6c55c74661d4b35bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,88,82,249,13,228,201,35,71,102,74,108,85,199,70,97,212,179,91,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
