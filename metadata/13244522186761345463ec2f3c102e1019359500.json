Opened on 14 December 1893, it is the third-oldest underground metro system in the world after the London Underground and Budapest Metro. Formerly a cable railway, the Subway was later electrified, but its twin circular lines were never expanded. Originally known as the Glasgow District Railway, the system was renamed the Glasgow Underground in 1936. Despite this rebranding, many Glaswegians resolutely continued to refer to the network as &quot;the Subway&quot;. In 2003 the name &quot;Subway&quot; was officially readopted by its operator, the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT). A GBP 40,000 study examining the feasibility of an expansion into the city's south side is in progress.\n\nThe system is not the oldest underground railway in Glasgow itself; that distinction belongs to a 5 km (3.1 mi) section of the Glasgow City and District Railway opened in 1863, now part of the North Clyde Line of the suburban railway network, which runs in a sub-surface tunnel under the city centre between High Street and west of Charing Cross. Another major section of underground suburban railway line in Glasgow is the Argyle Line, which was formerly part of the Glasgow Central Railway.\n\n=====================================\n\nPreview: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaIaGaadB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaIaGaadB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaIAhAADB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaIAhAADB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaiaiAADb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaiaiAADb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaiaKAAdb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaiaKAAdb&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13244522186761345463ec2f3c102e1019359500","amp;dn":"Glasgow+Subway+%28Kim+Rennie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13244522186761345463ec2f3c102e1019359500","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,36,69,34,24,103,97,52,84,99,236,47,60,16,46,16,25,53,149,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
