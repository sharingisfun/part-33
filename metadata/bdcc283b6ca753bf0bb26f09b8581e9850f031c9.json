It is not an ecranisation but a way of reality&amp;#039;s reflection. It is a story about war, love, duty and love but it is more. It is a poem in which light, acting and atmosphere are parts of a subtle description of a ordinary strange world.\n\nVictor Rebengiuc, at beginning of his impressive career, create a special character, with thinks, gestures, relationship in Dostoievsky&amp;#039;s style, but in a deep mode. The war is not a event, it is the principal character, every image, gorgeous image is one of conflict&amp;#039;s bones.\n\nThe mud, rope or questions have East European nimbus but the art of Ciulei is the convert of this atmosphere in essence of crisis. A world falls, an interior world, a conscience, and this event is the end of every hour of exterior time. Apostole Bologa is the prototype of anonymous anti-hero, he believes in values of every civilizations and who assist at there putrefaction.\n\nA splendid film of a huge director.\n\nsource: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058439/\n\n\nPlease Seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdcc283b6ca753bf0bb26f09b8581e9850f031c9","amp;dn":"Padurea+Spanzuratilor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdcc283b6ca753bf0bb26f09b8581e9850f031c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,204,40,59,108,167,83,191,11,178,111,9,184,88,30,152,80,240,49,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
