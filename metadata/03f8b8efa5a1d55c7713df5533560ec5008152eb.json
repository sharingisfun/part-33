It's helping scientists to create a new understanding of how our senses work - not as individual senses, but connected together.\nIt holds the intriguing possibility that one sense could be mapped into another. This is what happened to Daniel Kish, who lost his sight as a child. He is now able to create a vision of the world by clicking his tongue which allows him to echolocate like a bat.\nAnd in a series of MRI scans, scientists are now looking to find out if Daniel's brain may have actually rewired itself enabling him to use sound to create a visual image of the world.\n\nMon 18 Oct 2010  20:00GMT\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVcodec:    XviD 2pass MPEG\nAcodec:    AC3 192kbps/2ch\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03f8b8efa5a1d55c7713df5533560ec5008152eb","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+Is+seeing+believing+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03f8b8efa5a1d55c7713df5533560ec5008152eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,248,184,239,165,161,213,92,119,19,223,85,51,86,14,197,0,129,82,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
