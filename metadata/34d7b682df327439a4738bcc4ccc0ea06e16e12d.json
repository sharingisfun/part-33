Those seem like \nancient days, now. The state of the environment is of top interest among \nCanadians and the news media and governments are playing a frantic game of \ncatch up as we watch our fragile planet change significantly within the span of \nour own lifetimes.\n\nA sign of the change in viewpoint, certainly, was when &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, \na film about Al Gore&amp;#039;s lonely crusade to educate people about the perils of \nglobal warming, won an academy award this year for best documentary. The former \nVice President, long dismissed as a policy wonk on the environment, is now \nsomething of a folk hero, as he takes his message about green-thinking around \nthe Globe. Even two decades ago, Gore was an early warning voice on \nenvironmental challenges, so what a vindication for him to see a kind of an \nenvironmental revolution catch on with increasing force.\n\nThe Canadian writer, Thomas Homer Dixon, based at the University of Toronto, is \nanother former voice in the wilderness. He has been talking for years about a \ncoming collapse caused by global warming, energy scarcity, widening gaps \nbetween rich nations and poor ones and the need for western societies to \nrethink their dependencies on oil and other limited resources, and become more \nresilient and innovative and , well, green. Brian recently sat down for a \nconversation with Thomas Homer Dixon and they talked about this new era in \nenvironmental consciousness and why it&amp;#039;s a cause for hope.\n\nWestern societies are increasingly aware and vocal about global warming, in \nparticular, but there is some hypocrisy to all of this, poorer nations say. \nTake, for instance China. Millions of people there hope to attain the lifestyle \nof the middle-class for the first time ever. That means cars, and modern \nappliances, and all the things we take for granted in the West and which \ncontribute to global warming and pollution.The Chinese citizen has a right to \naspire to an easier life, but the cost to the environment, just because of the \nenormous size of the population, is terrifying.We have a report from the CBC&amp;#039;s \nBeijing-based correspondent Michel Cormier about China&amp;#039;s looming environmental \nproblem.\n\nAfter that, so as to not  leave you discouraged, we leave you with a report by \nCBC reporter Joan Leishman about how some Canadians are making a difference by \nshopping for clean energy sources.\n\n\n\n--\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34d7b682df327439a4738bcc4ccc0ea06e16e12d","amp;dn":"Environmental+Revolution+-+CBC+-+Our+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34d7b682df327439a4738bcc4ccc0ea06e16e12d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,215,182,130,223,50,116,57,164,115,139,204,76,204,14,160,110,22,225,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
