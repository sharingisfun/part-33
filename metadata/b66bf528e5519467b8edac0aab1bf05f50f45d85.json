Soft, calm and airy. Quiet solo piano that is full of warmth and emotion. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.solopianodiary.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.solopianodiary.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReview\nDeeply Personal and Beautiful!\n&quot;Solo Piano Diary&quot; is the debut release from Swedish pianist/composer Christian Lindquist, and what a beauty it is! Quiet, introspective, and deeply personal.\n\nThe twenty-five pieces are mostly short (1 1/2 - 3 1/2 minutes in length), but are perfect in their brevity, conveying all they need to say without a lot of frills or fanfare. Christian Lindquist is an artist whose music expresses almost as much with the spaces between the notes as the notes themselves. This is music to get lost in, hoping never to be found again! There are no weak tracks on &quot;Solo Piano Diary&quot;,.... read the full review at mainlypiano.com\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Artist has released this full album tracks free on internet. Enjoy!\nIf you like it you can donate.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b66bf528e5519467b8edac0aab1bf05f50f45d85","amp;dn":"Soft+Quiet+Piano+Music+-+Christian+Lindquist+-+Solo+Piano+Diary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b66bf528e5519467b8edac0aab1bf05f50f45d85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,107,245,40,229,81,148,103,184,237,172,10,171,27,240,95,80,244,93,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
