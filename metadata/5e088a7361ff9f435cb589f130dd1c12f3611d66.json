The Duke&amp;#039;s band was just returning from a Florida stint, and the ensuing, impromptu &quot;Welcome Home&quot; bash broke out at Columbia&amp;#039;s studios in New York. Jimmy Rushing stopped in, as did Dizzy Gillespie and a couple dozen other admirers. Musically, the Ellington unit is in prime form, taking up the recent percussion-heavy &quot;Malletoba Spank&quot; and &quot;Tymperturbably Blue&quot; with polyrhythmic gusto and ripping through &quot;Ready, Go!&quot; in tight, swaggering form. Dizzy&amp;#039;s trumpet chimes in on &quot;U.M.M.G.&quot; and &quot;Hello Little Girl,&quot; playing muted solos that fit like a hand in the band&amp;#039;s welcoming glove. This recording has the earmarks of a party, per its title, and the shindig was hopping.\n\nMusicians:\nDizzy Gillespie, Ray Nance, Clark Terry, Cat Anderson, Shorty Baker, Andres Ford (trumpets)\nJohnny Hodges, Paul Gonzalves, Harry Carney, Jimmy Hamilton, Russell Procope (saxophones)\nBritt Woodman, Quentin Jackson, John Sanders (trombones)\nDuke Ellington, Jimmy Jones (piano)\nJimmy Woode (bass)\nSam Woodyard (drums)\nJimmy Rushing (vocalist)\nMorris Goldenberg, George Gaber, Elden C.
