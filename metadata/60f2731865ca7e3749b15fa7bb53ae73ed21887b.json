Playing to packed houses from Budokan to Bonaroo and back again, MMW is one of the most popular and vibrant modern instrumental ensembles around. Original members of the earliest Masada family units (reaching back to 1993), they are keenly in tune with ZornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical world, and a natural choice to interpret the lyrical Book of Angels. Returning to the fold like three prodigal sons, they have created twelve exhilarating arrangements that alternately groove, loop, shred and burn with a fiery passion.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60f2731865ca7e3749b15fa7bb53ae73ed21887b","amp;dn":"Medeski+Martin+and+Wood+-+Zaebos%3A+Book+Of+Angels+Vol.11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60f2731865ca7e3749b15fa7bb53ae73ed21887b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,242,115,24,101,202,126,55,73,177,95,167,187,83,174,115,237,33,136,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
