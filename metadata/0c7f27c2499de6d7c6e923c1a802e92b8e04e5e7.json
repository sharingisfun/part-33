Sanders, I know kinda weirdÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it's a long storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦you can just call me &quot;T Dub&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nI have been playing World of Warcraft for about four years now, well before it was out of closed beta. The thrill of the game for me, more than anything else, has always been the fast paced, face to face action of PvP. Over the years, the game has advanced, adding more content, extending the depth of that PvP interaction and making it so anyone with the right practice and resources could step into the ring and prove that they were the very best.\n\nOver the years, I have amassed over 100,000 honorable kills, maybe a million honor points, and achieved top 10 ranking in my battle group for my 2v2 team. I have rarely lost matches against anyone who was not geared to the teeth and fully prepared and have never been intimidated by a match no matter how far flung the odds are against me. \n\nFrom: http://www.pvpbible.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7f27c2499de6d7c6e923c1a802e92b8e04e5e7","amp;dn":"PvP+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7f27c2499de6d7c6e923c1a802e92b8e04e5e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,127,39,194,73,157,230,215,198,233,35,193,168,2,233,43,142,4,229,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
