On top of that, it can rip DVDs and cut movies into smaller, more manageable fragments. In our testing, we appreciated the program's conversion speed and quality. Total Video Converter is well-suited for batch conversion. We found the interface straightforward, with one minor exception: the cumbersome Select Format dialog. Unfortunately, none of these features come for free: in addition to the 15-day restriction, the trial version stamps movies with a registration reminder. The $45.95 registration fee may make your jaw drop, too. Though it's not exactly a bargain, Total Video Converter is much more complete and competent than most of its competitors. If price is no object, it's definitely worth a look.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a4fad292d56fe97930ab84bafdd739b0163cbb6","amp;dn":"Total+Video+Converter+3.61+Wth+Crack+Working+Perfect","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a4fad292d56fe97930ab84bafdd739b0163cbb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,79,173,41,45,86,254,151,147,10,184,75,175,221,115,155,1,99,203,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
