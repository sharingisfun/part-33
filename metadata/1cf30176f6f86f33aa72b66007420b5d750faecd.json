Great voice, and she sings about things from Firefly and Battlestar Galactica.  What's not to like?  Even if you've never seen an episode of either the songs are still moving on their own.  The overall style is kind of a folksy songwriter vibe, but Marian has a crystal-clean voice to back it up.  A nice, relaxed feel with room to breathe.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. I'll Still be a Geek After Nobody Thinks It's Chic\n2. Good Old Girl\n3. Don't Try\n4. Dark Dark Eyes\n5. Vera Flew the Coop\n6. It's Good to Have Jayne on Your Side\n7. In the Black\n8. Got to Fly\n9. It Was Good for You Too\n\nAll at 128kbps for those who care.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cf30176f6f86f33aa72b66007420b5d750faecd","amp;dn":"Marian+Call+-+Got+to+Fly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cf30176f6f86f33aa72b66007420b5d750faecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,243,1,118,246,248,111,51,170,114,182,96,7,66,11,93,117,15,174,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
