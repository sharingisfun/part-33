Trynin is a gifted songstress, not unlike Liz Phair or fellow Boston native Aimee Mann (who contributes backing vocals to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Snow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and, like them, the pitfalls of romance occupy such of Trynin\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s lyrical concern. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Everything\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s Different Now\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is a grungy, funky workout that reflects on the attraction to saving people and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;One Year Down\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is a melodic, garage pop gem. She mixes things up, though. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Snow\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Better Than Nothing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; are two slacker anthems that succeed because of their unselfconscious tone. The former is a smoldering, mid-tempo number with creamy harmony vocals, while the latter is a delicious, upbeat racket, packing a triple-espresso shot. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;If I Had Anything to Say (Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t You Think I Would Have Said It All?)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is a wickedly wonderful, sonic whiplash. Cockamamie is an impressive release that deserved a wider audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26d7da077a130fc5b8192f2e6aa3b6591f5296ab","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Trynin+-+Cockamamie+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26d7da077a130fc5b8192f2e6aa3b6591f5296ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,215,218,7,122,19,15,197,184,25,47,46,106,163,182,89,31,82,150,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
