I have no idea why they number it the way they do. So, as confusing as this is, please go by the accurate synopsis that I got at the time I capped these shows from here http://www.yourtv.com.au/guide/restofday/\n\nA lively man from the US arrives on a tourist visa, \nbut Immigration believes he may be here to work illegally. \nAnd despite his claim of a clean criminal record, officers findings prove otherwise. A shipment from Hong Kong ostensibly containing three standard household doors \nprovokes officers' interests when one of the doors is heavier than the others. An X-ray shows there may be organic matter concealed inside. Then, two men from the Philippines arrive for a holiday after spending time working in Papua New Guinea, but Customs and Border Protection officers are concerned about \ntheir last-minute flight changes and lack of knowledge about what to see and do in Brisbane.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5994697b1763ef214c70a14e0d950601e7fe9eb","amp;dn":"Border.Security.AU.Front.Line.S14E05.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5994697b1763ef214c70a14e0d950601e7fe9eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,153,70,151,177,118,62,242,20,199,10,20,224,217,80,96,30,127,233,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
