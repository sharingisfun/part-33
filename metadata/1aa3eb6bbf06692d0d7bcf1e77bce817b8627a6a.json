He has written on economic, scientific, and political topics, as well as on history, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Journalists and government officials in China, Italy and Russia have credited LaRouche with forecasting that unrestricted financial speculation would cause the late-2000s financial crisis.[1]\nLaRouche was a presidential candidate eight times between 1976 to 2004, running once for his own U.S. Labor Party and campaigning seven times for the Democratic Party nomination. He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in 1988 for conspiracy to commit mail fraud and tax code violations, and was released in 1994 on parole. Ramsey Clark, who was LaRouche's chief appellate attorney and a former U.S. Attorney General, said that the prosecution was politically motivated, and that LaRouche was denied a fair trial.[2] The Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the appeal.[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa3eb6bbf06692d0d7bcf1e77bce817b8627a6a","amp;dn":"The+case+of+Walter+Lippmann%3A+A+presidential+strategy+%28University","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa3eb6bbf06692d0d7bcf1e77bce817b8627a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,163,235,107,191,6,105,45,13,123,207,30,119,188,232,23,184,98,122,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
