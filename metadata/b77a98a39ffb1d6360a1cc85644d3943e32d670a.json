Perhaps the most successful instrumental rocker of his time, he may have also been the man most responsible (along with Chuck Berry) for popularizing the electric rock guitar. His distinctively low, twangy riffs could be heard on no less than 15 Top 40 hits between 1958 and 1963. He was also one of the first rock stars to successfully crack the LP market.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/duane-eddy-p4166/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/duane-eddy-p4166/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nSomewhere along the way, Motown acquired the rights to Jamie Records, which is the reason they released a Duane Eddy two-fer as part of their first wave of CD two-fers in the mid-'80s. The label put Have 'Twangy' Guitar -- Will Travel and $1,000,000 Worth of Twang, arguably his two finest albums, on one disc. Motown's initial CD two-fers were criticized in many quarters for shoddy, unattractive packaging and indifferent remastering, but less discriminating consumers will find this acceptable, since it contains the original versions of most of his hits on one disc. This particular disc didn't stay in print for too long and was later replaced with better-sounding, more thorough collections, which are preferable to this adequate collection.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/have-twangy-guitar-will-travel-1000000-worth-of-twang-r6578&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/have-twangy-guitar-will-travel-1000000-worth-of-twang-r6578&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============\n\nHave 'Twangy' Guitar-Will Travel\nAMG Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nDuane Eddy's debut album, Have 'Twangy' Guitar-Will Travel, was a good value by the standards of the era, with several of his early hits and favorites (&quot;Rebel Rouser,&quot; &quot;Cannonball,&quot; &quot;Ramrod,&quot; &quot;Movin' and Groovin',&quot; and &quot;Three-30-Blues &quot;) included. Many of the songs, though, appear on whatever greatest-hits anthology you're likely to pick up; Rhino's Twang Thang, for instance, has no less than nine of the 12 tracks. The 1999 CD reissue (which is in stereo) adds three 1958 B-sides that aren't always likely to show up on anthologies -- &quot;Up and Down,&quot; &quot;The Walker,&quot; and &quot;Mason-Dixon Line&quot; -- as well as historical liner notes. The album was also issued on a two-fer CD by Motown, teamed with the 1960 album $1,000,000 Worth of Twang.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/have-twangy-guitar-will-travel-r245005&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/have-twangy-guitar-will-travel-r245005&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============\n\n$1,000,000 Worth of Twang\nAMG Review by Cub Koda\n\nSolid best-of collection of Duane Eddy's earliest hits, including &quot;Rebel Rouser,&quot; &quot;Movin' &amp; Groovin',&quot; &quot;Ramrod,&quot; and &quot;Forty Miles of Bad Road.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/1000000-worth-of-twang-r6579&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/1000000-worth-of-twang-r6579&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TO327K&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TO327K&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
