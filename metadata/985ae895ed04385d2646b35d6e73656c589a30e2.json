It introduces IT professionals to the highly structured world of law enforcement, where rules of evidence must be followed closely and crime scenes must not be contaminated. It provides law enforcement officers with an understanding of the technical aspects of cybercrime and of how technology can be used to help solve crimes that have been committed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:985ae895ed04385d2646b35d6e73656c589a30e2","amp;dn":"Scene+of+the+Cybercrime%3A+Computer+Forensics+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"985ae895ed04385d2646b35d6e73656c589a30e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,90,232,149,237,4,56,93,38,70,179,93,110,115,101,108,88,154,48,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
