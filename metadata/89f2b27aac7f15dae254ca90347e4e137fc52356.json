In 2008, lead singer Kirstin Gundred (aka Dee Dee) began making solo recordings as Dum Dum Girls, deriving the name both from the VaselinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ album Dum-Dum and from the Iggy Pop song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dum Dum Boys.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Over the course of the next year, Dee Dee released a couple singles (a 7&quot; single on Hozac, a four-way split single on Art Fag), a 12&quot; EP (Yours Alone, released via Captured Tracks), and a compilation disc appearance (on Art FagÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blissed Out cassette comp). Thanks to the high level of buzz surrounding Dee Dee (and, of course, the quality of the records), Sub Pop signed Dum Dum Girls in 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f2b27aac7f15dae254ca90347e4e137fc52356","amp;dn":"Dum+Dum+Girls+-+Too+True+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f2b27aac7f15dae254ca90347e4e137fc52356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,242,178,122,172,127,21,218,226,84,202,144,52,126,78,19,127,197,35,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
