The crew mutinies against Larsen's many crimes, and though van Weyden, Maud, and George try to escape Larsen's clutches, they find themselves drawn inexorably back to him as the &quot;Ghost&quot; sails toward disaster. The mini-series is based on a novel by Jack London with some parts from other novels of LondonÃ‚Â´s.\n\nIn my opinion, itÃ‚Â´s the best existing sea-wolf adaption. I would like to add english audio and subs, but the BluRay doesnÃ‚Â´t contain any other than german audio and no subs.\n\nMaybe someone of you is able to do that. Id would be highly appreciated, so this masterpiece could be understood worldwide.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066709/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066709/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!\n\nComments are welcome!\n\nNCC-1701-j","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21fe74c77f69eef25fe6c96385ac1d4d9b38bd37","amp;dn":"Seewolf+mini-series+german+1972+BluRay+part+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21fe74c77f69eef25fe6c96385ac1d4d9b38bd37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,254,116,199,127,105,238,242,95,230,201,99,133,172,29,77,155,56,189,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
