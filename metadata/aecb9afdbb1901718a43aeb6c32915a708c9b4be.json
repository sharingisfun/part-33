Their early work was heavily influenced by NWOBHM, and was key in the development of US Power Metal. With each work the band developed into a pure progressive metal style. Fates Warning has experienced numerous line-up changes. From 1982 to 1996 â€” and temporarily in 2010 â€” Matheos and DiBiase were the only remaining original members of the band, with Matheos being the only constant member. \r\n\r\nTheir current lineup consists of guitarists Jim Matheos and Frank Aresti, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. As a pioneer of the American progressive metal movement, Fates Warning rose to international fame in the 1980s and was ranked as one of the early &quot;flagship bands of progressive metal&quot; along with QueensrÃ¿che and Dream Theater, who were responsible for creating, developing and popularizing that genre.\r\n\r\nYear:\t2013\r\nStyle:\tProgressive Metal\r\nCountry:\tUSA\r\nFormat:\t320 mp3\r\nSize:\t181.07 MB\r\n\r\n\t\r\nAdded:\t13/06/2016 \r\nFiles:\t14\r\n\r\nDescription:\t\r\nDuration: 01:18:49\r\n\r\nTracks :\r\n\r\nCD1:\r\n\r\n01.
