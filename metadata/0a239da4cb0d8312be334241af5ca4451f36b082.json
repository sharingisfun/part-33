Paul Wilson, hailed by the Rocky Mountain News as Ã¢â‚¬Å“among the finest storytellers of our times.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe title novelette won the Bram Stoker Award and its companions touch on the past, present, and futureÃ¢â‚¬â€from the inflationary insanity of Weimar Germany (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aryans and AbsintheÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to disco clubÃ¢â‚¬â€œera Manhattan (Ã¢â‚¬Å“When He Was FabÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), to the rationing of medical services in a grim near future (Ã¢â‚¬Å“OffshoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stylistic diversity and versatility are on display in stories that pay tribute to Ray Bradbury (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The November GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), use a sentient killer virus as a point-of-view character (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lysing toward BethlehemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and pay unabashed homage to pure pulp fiction in two yellow peril stories (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex Slaves of the Dragon TongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Part of the GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). And finally, Wilson treats us to his popular antihero Repairman Jack at his most inventive: trapped in a drugstore with four killers (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Interlude at DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nEPUB AND MOBI.
