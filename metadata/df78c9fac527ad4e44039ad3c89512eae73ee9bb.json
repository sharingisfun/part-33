Adler &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blog.adlermusic.com/2010/11/on-odean-pope-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blog.adlermusic.com/2010/11/on-odean-pope-2.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTenor saxophonist Odean Pope is a Philadelphia institution: a practice buddy of\nColtraneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in his youth, a sideman with Max Roach for 22 years, now a mentor to\nPhillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up-and-comers and leader of a nine-horn saxophone choir, along with\nvarious small groups. Thanks to a steady flow of recent releases, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to\nassess not only PopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s busy present career, but also areas of his overlooked\npast...\n\n--\n\nby Ed Hazell &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD29/PoD29MoreMoments5.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD29/PoD29MoreMoments5.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n... Fresh Breeze features Pope fronting an all Philly quartet with alto\nsaxophonist Bobby Zankel, bassist Lee Smith, and drummer Craig McIver that\npatrols the outer edges of post bop and modal jazz. The open expanses of\npianoless groups have always been a good fit for PopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concept. Some of his\nbest work on record comes from his long tenure in Max RoachÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pianoless\nquartet. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also led his own trios Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an early one with Cornell Rochester and\nGerald Veasley comes immediately to mind, along with others that included\neither bassist Smith or Tyrone Brown and drummer McIver. Although heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worked\nwith pianists like Dave Burrell and Hassan Ibn Ali, Pope doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily\nneed one, since he generally will fill in all the harmonic cracks anyway as he\nsteamrolls through his solo. They give him the space he needs to work out his\nharmonic ideas at length...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df78c9fac527ad4e44039ad3c89512eae73ee9bb","amp;dn":"Odean+Pope+Quartet+-+Fresh+Breeze+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df78c9fac527ad4e44039ad3c89512eae73ee9bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,120,201,250,197,39,173,78,68,3,154,211,200,149,18,234,231,62,233,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
