From wrestling Nile crocodiles to witnessing Lena the western lowland gorilla giving birth to her new baby Kituba, follow all the animals' amazing stories from a year in Dublin Zoo. The cameras join the keepers every step of the way, even when their work takes them as far as England, France and South Africa!

The keepers also carry out tests on a new male pygmy marmoset, which is the world's smallest type of monkey, and a giraffe develops the same abnormality in its hooves that killed its mother\n\n7)  Part 7 \nCiaran MacMahon helps a male African hunting dog that has being injured during the mating season, and reptile expert Garth De Jong discovers a clutch of eggs in the leopard tortoise habitat.
