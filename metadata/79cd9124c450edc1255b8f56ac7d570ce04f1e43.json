This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nWe have the first top 40 hit by a Christian heavy metal band.\n\nOne song in the countdown has been remade five times before. Including its original release, this is the seventh time it has been in the top 40.\n\nThe first male solo singer to ever have three number one hits from the same album is in this countdown with a fourth song debuting from that same album.\n\nThere are four acts in this countdown that have charted in three decades; the 60's, the 70's and the 80's.\n\nOne artist in the countdown holds the record for having the most top ten hits, eleven of them, without ever hitting number one.\n\nOne artist in the coundown &quot;borrowed&quot; two pieces of music from Rachmaninoff, and every time one of those songs plays, he pays. Casey gives the details.\n\n40:    Rocket 2 U - The Jets\n39:    Crazy - Icehouse\n38:    Honestly - Stryper            \n37:    (Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay - Michael Bolton\n36:    The Man In The Mirror - Michael Jackson\n35:    Hysteria - Def Leppard\n34:    I Want Her - Keith Sweat\n33:    Out Of The Blue - Debbie Gibson\n32:    853-5937 - Squeeze\n31:    Be Still My Beating Heart - Sting\n30:    Because Of You - The Cover Girls\n29:    Candle In The Wind - Elton John\n28:    Tell It To My Heart - Taylor Dayne\n27:    Love Overboard - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips        \n26:    Endless Summer Nights - Richard Marx\n25:    Got My Mind Set On You - George Harrison\n24:    The Way You Make Me Feel - Michael Jackson\nExtra: Cupid Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sam Cooke\n23:    Just Like Paradise - David Lee Roth\n22:    I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man - Prince\n21:    Push It - Salt-N-Pepa\n20:    Pop Goes The World - Men Without Hats\n19:    I Found Someone - Cher\n18:    I Get Weak - Belinda Carlisle\n17:    Pump Up The Volume - M/A/R/R/S\n16:    Can't Stay Away From You - Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine\n15:    I Live For Your Love - Natalie Cole\n14:    Everywhere - Fleetwood Mac\n13:    Tunnel Of Love - Bruce Springsteen\n12:    Father Figure - George Michael\n11:    Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley\n10:    She's Like The Wind - Patrick Swayze (Featuring Wendy Fraser)\n9:    Don't Shed A Tear - Paul Carrack\n8:    Say You Will - Foreigner\n7:    Hazy Shade Of Winter - The Bangles\n6:    Need You Tonight - INXS\n5:    What Have I Done To Deserve This - The Pet Shop Boys &amp; Dusty Springfield\n4:    Hungry Eyes (From &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;) - Eric Carmen\n3:    I Want To Be Your Man - Roger\n2:    Seasons Change - Expose\n1:    Could've Been Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tiffany\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79cd9124c450edc1255b8f56ac7d570ce04f1e43","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1988_February_13th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79cd9124c450edc1255b8f56ac7d570ce04f1e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,205,145,36,196,80,237,193,37,91,143,86,172,125,87,12,224,79,30,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
