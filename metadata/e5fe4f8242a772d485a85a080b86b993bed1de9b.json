Anti-Spy 2.1.1 was a short lived anti-spyware program that was included in the Yahoo! toolbar a long time ago.It was pretty much useless except for the fact that it can find and remove Grokster(which is in uTorrent), which not only slows down your PC but is illegal from what I hear.Other than that, it seems to mostly find false positives(it tells you to remove uTorrent).Since it is so old there are usually installation problems.Just right click on it and choose &quot;troubleshoot compatibility&quot;,select that it used to work on XP and it should work.You may have to try a few different options but I have gotten it to work on 7,8,8.1 and 10.\r\nIf the program finds anything it will suggest running a complete scan but don't waste your time.It takes forever and never finds anything.Also please note that Grokster will be installed every time you run uTorrent.I always remove it and figured there might be others who would also want to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5fe4f8242a772d485a85a080b86b993bed1de9b","amp;dn":"CA+Yahoo%21+Anti-Spy+2.1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5fe4f8242a772d485a85a080b86b993bed1de9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,254,79,130,66,167,114,212,133,168,90,8,11,134,185,147,190,209,222,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
