Mitchell interviewed Worth in 1987 and his recording forms the backbone of this tribute, in the 20th anniversary year of the comedian's death.\n\nHarry Worth's television and radio shows drew comparisons with Tony Hancock, and the famous opening gag of his TV series, that of Harry posing beside a shop window so that his reflection suggests a man spreadeagled in mid-air, is still fondly remembered - and imitated - by public and professionals alike.\n\nThe programme tells his story through interviews with Harry and his friends and colleagues and, perhaps for the first time, explains why his career lost direction for over a decade before getting back on track shortly before his death. Including contributions from producers John Ammonds and William G Stewart and actor Jonathan Cecil.\n\n\nHarry Worth - The Man In The Window\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27mn 40s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59caae5d64fde88d130dc3abb58843f750c97b3","amp;dn":"Thirty+Minutes+%28Harry%29+Worth+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59caae5d64fde88d130dc3abb58843f750c97b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,156,170,229,214,79,222,136,209,48,220,58,187,88,132,63,117,12,151,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
