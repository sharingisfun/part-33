Luckily there are many specialized tools with this goal, such as HitmanPro. It is a powerful application that can detect and remove most Viruses that could come in contact with your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloud-Assisted Virus Remover\r\n\r\nRigjht off the bat you can nitice a great thing about this utility, namely the fact that it used a Cloud-Engine when scanning, therefore several Anti-Malware engines are at work to help you find and obliterate any trace of Malicious-Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind and remove threats easily\r\n\r\nAnother neat feature of HitmanPro is the ability to run without installation when needed, so it can be used from a portable storage device. In case you wish to keep it on your computer, through, select the option to create a copy of the utility, so you can regularly scan your computert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe default scan takes a few minutes to complete and you can track the Real-Time progress and view on the spot any suspicious or dangerous items found in your system. Viruses or other types of computer infections can be either deleted, quarantined, ignored (not recommended) or reported as safe. A small description of each threat is displayed below the files in the list, as well as the level of risk it presents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation and conclusion\r\n\r\nDuring my tesxt, HitmanPro managed to find a lot of Tracking Cookies and a couple of Suspicious Executable Files in the Temporary Internet Files Folder, which were swiftly removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all, this application looks and works very well. Even if it may not be suited as a first line of defense, HitmanPro can surely prove a great addition that can work alongside a fully-fledged Anti-Virus solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog (HitmanPro 3.7.13 Build 258 -2016-02-25):\r\n\r\n- FIXED: Save Log button (was broken since build 256)\r\n- UPDATE: Polish language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7904f4aa0f29b8123724799a8e6c562736888b40","amp;dn":"HitmanPro+3.7.13+Build+258+%2B+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7904f4aa0f29b8123724799a8e6c562736888b40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,4,244,170,15,41,184,18,55,36,121,154,142,108,86,39,54,136,139,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
