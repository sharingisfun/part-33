Kemal and Sibel, children of two :\n : prominent families, are about to become engaged. But when Kemal encounters :\n : FÃƒÂ¼sun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation, he becomes enthralled. :\n : And once they violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between :\n : Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeoisie. In his pursuit:\n : of FÃƒÂ¼sun over the next eight years, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of:\n : objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress--amassing a museum that is    :\n : both a map of a society and of his heart. Orhan Pamuk's first novel since  :\n : winning the Nobel Prize is a stirring exploration of the nature of romance.:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbe4e5aa1d568316189a6e51a9fc6762bbd87f19","amp;dn":"Orhan+Pamuk+The+Museum+of+Innocence+2009+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbe4e5aa1d568316189a6e51a9fc6762bbd87f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,228,229,170,29,86,131,22,24,154,110,81,169,252,103,98,187,216,127,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
