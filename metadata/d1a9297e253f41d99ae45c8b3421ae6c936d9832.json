(The acronym stands for\nComputer-Aided Drafting, Computer-Aided Design, or both, depending on\nwhom you talk to). ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s almost as amazing that, 20 years after its birth,\nAutoCAD remains the king of the microcomputer CAD hill by a tall margin.\nMany competing CAD programs have come to challenge AutoCAD, many have\nfallen, and a few are still around. One hears rumblings that the long-term\nfuture of CAD may belong to special-purpose, 3D-based software such as the\nAutodesk Inventor and Revit programs. Whether or not those rumblings\namplify into a roar remains to be seen, but for the present and the near future\nanyway, AutoCAD is where the CAD action is.\n\nIn its evolution, AutoCAD has grown more complex, in part to keep up with\nthe increasing complexity of the design and drafting processes that AutoCAD\nis intended to serve. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not enough just to draw nice-looking lines anymore.\nIf you want to play CAD with the big boys and girls, you need to organize the\nobjects you draw, their properties, and the files in which they reside in\nappropriate ways. You need to coordinate your CAD work with other people\nin your office who will be working on or making use of the same drawings.\nYou need to be savvy about shipping drawings around via the Internet.\n\nAutoCAD 2005 provides the tools for doing all these things, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not always\neasy to figure out which hammer to pick up or which nail to bang on first.\nWith this book, you have an excellent chance of creating a presentable,\nusable, printable, and sharable drawing on your first or second try without\nputting a T square through your computer screen in frustration.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1a9297e253f41d99ae45c8b3421ae6c936d9832","amp;dn":"AutoCAD+2005+for+Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1a9297e253f41d99ae45c8b3421ae6c936d9832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,169,41,126,37,63,65,217,154,228,92,139,52,33,174,108,147,109,152,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
