It may be used\nas a textbook for graduate course on theoretical computer science.\n\nThe book introduces a reader to the conceptual framework for thinking\nabout computations with the objects. The several areas of theoretical\ncomputer science are covered, including the following: type\nfree and typed \u0015-calculus and combinatory logic with applications,\nevaluation of expressions, computations in a category. The topics,\ncovered in the book accumulated much experience in teaching these\nsubjects in graduate computer science courses.\n\nA rich set of examples and exercises, including solutions, has been\nprepared to stimulate the self studying and to make easier the job of\ninstructor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95894dae7a6bf7b33a773e4e01245e0fae99abd","amp;dn":"Combinatory+Logic+in+Programming.+Computations+with+objects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d95894dae7a6bf7b33a773e4e01245e0fae99abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,88,148,218,231,166,191,123,51,167,115,228,224,18,69,224,250,233,154,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
