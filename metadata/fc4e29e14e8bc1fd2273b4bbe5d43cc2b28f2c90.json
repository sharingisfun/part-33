The police won't listen. What would you do? Abbie Taylor shows remarkable flair in this involving and intriguing debut novel. A young mother's nightmare comes true... the tube doors close with her baby still on the train. Struggling as a single mother, Emma sometimes wishes that her thirteen-month-old son Ritchie would just disappear. \n\nBut when, one quiet Sunday evening, Ritchie is abducted by a stranger on the London Underground, Emma is thrown into a situation worse than she could have ever imagined. But why don't the police seem to fully believe her story? Why would they think that she would want to hurt her own baby? \n\nIf Emma wants Richie back, it looks like she'll have to find him herself. With the help of a stranger called Rafe, the one person who seems to believe her, she goes in search of her son. And she is determined to get him back... no matter what it takes.\n\nGenre: Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc4e29e14e8bc1fd2273b4bbe5d43cc2b28f2c90","amp;dn":"Emma%27s+Baby+by+Abbie+Taylor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc4e29e14e8bc1fd2273b4bbe5d43cc2b28f2c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,78,41,225,78,139,193,253,34,115,180,187,229,212,60,194,178,143,44,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
