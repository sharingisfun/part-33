Extensive 3rd-rail electrification of the Southern Region led to the widespread adoption of these practical EMUs, and the 4CIG (British Rail Class 421) was initially introduced on the London-Brighton Line before being pressed into service on the Portsmouth Direct Line between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. The 4CIG units received a facelift in the late 1980s, and were eventually withdrawn from mainline passenger service in the early 2000s.\n\nThe 4CIG for RailWorks 2 includes BR Blue/Grey and Network Southeast liveries and 5 scenarios.\n\n\n5 Scenarios\nSouthern Electric\nCity Limited\nSlammed Doors\nBattle of Havant\nGuildford 70C\n***PLEASE NOTE that you will need the Portsmouth Direct Line Expansion Pack in order to play the scenarios included with the 4CIG Add-On.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2863ce21aea5667ebb1d2e374ed35fe891682c","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+4+CIG+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2863ce21aea5667ebb1d2e374ed35fe891682c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,40,99,206,33,174,165,102,126,187,29,46,55,78,211,95,232,145,104,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
