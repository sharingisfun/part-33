As public interest in twins and multiple births steadily increases, the amount of in-depth information available on such topics has not kept up. In Entwined Lives, preeminent twins researcher Dr. Nancy Segal provides a groundbreaking study of all aspects of twin life, capturing both the scientific flavor of twin research and the unique experiences associated with development as a twin. This insightful and comprehensive book brings together an array of topics including twins separated at birth, unrelated children reared together at birth (pseudo-twins), the loss of a twin, new fertility treatments and their consequences, twins in sports, twins in the courtroom, even twins in the animal kingdom. Packed with scientific findings and anecdotes, Entwined Lives is a definitive guide for twins, their families, and anyone curious to know more about this phenomenon.\n\n416 pages\nPublisher: Plume; 1 edition (April 1, 2000)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0452280575\nISBN-13: 978-0452280571","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8246d865a3894a72b725c486c19e9113ff4e3f54","amp;dn":"Entwined+Lives%3A+Twins+and+What+They+Say+About+Human+Behavior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8246d865a3894a72b725c486c19e9113ff4e3f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,70,216,101,163,137,74,114,183,37,196,134,193,158,145,19,255,78,63,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
