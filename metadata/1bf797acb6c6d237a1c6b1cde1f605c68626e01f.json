Set theory is then introduced and serves as the basis for defining relations, functions, numbers, mathematical induction, ordinals, and cardinals. The book concludes with a primer on basic model theory with applications to abstract algebra. A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory also includes:\r\n\r\nSection exercises designed to show the interactions between topics and reinforce the presented ideas and concepts\r\nNumerous examples that illustrate theorems and employ basic concepts such as Euclidâ€™s lemma, the Fibonacci sequence, and unique factorization\r\nCoverage of important theorems including the well-ordering theorem, completeness theorem, compactness theorem, as well as the theorems of LÃ¶wenheimâ€“Skolem, Burali-Forti, Hartogs, Cantorâ€“SchrÃ¶derâ€“Bernstein, and KÃ¶nig\r\nAn excellent textbook for students studying the foundations of mathematics and mathematical proofs, A First Course in Mathematical Logic and Set Theory is also appropriate for readers preparing for careers in mathematics education or computer science. In addition, the book is ideal for introductory courses on mathematical logic and/or set theory and appropriate for upper-undergraduate transition courses with rigorous mathematical reasoning involving algebra, number theory, or analysis.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf797acb6c6d237a1c6b1cde1f605c68626e01f","amp;dn":"A+First+Course+in+Mathematical+Logic+and+Set+Theory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf797acb6c6d237a1c6b1cde1f605c68626e01f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,247,151,172,182,198,210,55,161,198,177,205,225,246,5,198,134,38,224,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
