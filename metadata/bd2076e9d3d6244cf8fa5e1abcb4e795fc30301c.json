Drawing on his own familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history as spice traders, as well as travel narratives, historical accounts, and his expertise as an ethnobotanist, Nabhan describes the critical roles that Semitic peoples and desert floras had in setting the stage for globalized spice trade.\n\nTraveling along four prominent trade routesÃ¢â‚¬â€the Silk Road, the Frankincense Trail, the Spice Route, and the Camino Real (for chiles and chocolate)Ã¢â‚¬â€Nabhan follows the caravans of itinerant spice merchants from the frankincense-gathering grounds and ancient harbors of the Arabian Peninsula to the port of Zayton on the China Sea to Santa Fe in the southwest United States. His stories, recipes, and linguistic analyses of cultural diffusion routes reveal the extent to which aromatics such as cumin, cinnamon, saffron, and peppers became adopted worldwide as signature ingredients of diverse cuisines. Cumin, Camels, and Caravans demonstrates that two particular desert cultures often depicted in constant conflictÃ¢â‚¬â€Arabs and JewsÃ¢â‚¬â€have spent much of their history collaborating in the spice trade and suggests how a more virtuous multicultural globalized society may be achieved in the future.&quot;\n\nReviews:\n&quot;Richly embroidered with detail, Cumin, Camels, and Caravans by scholar Gary Paul Nabhan is part history, part geography, part cookbook, and part travel memoir. . . . Interspersed with recipes from various stops on historical spice routes, Nabhan discusses the botany, linguistic history, and trade history of each substance, but far from being dry accounts, they bring the wonder of many ingredients we now view as commonplace into focus; Nabhan's painstaking research has not eclipsed an evident natural knack for storytelling.&quot; -Saveur \n\n&quot;Heady historical and cultural study of ancient trade routes. . . . Nabhan adds pungent pinches of botany and gastronomy.&quot; -Nature\n\nThis torrent contains the original EPUB as well as conversions into MOBI, AZW3, LIT, and large print PDF formats done in Calibre.
