Being able to process data relatively quickly you are tasked with bringing as much research and knowledge back to Earth via an orbital station known as &quot;The Ark.&quot; At the Ark, you are able to recruit a crew, alter the layout of your ship, and perform research to improve current and new technology in order to aid you on future missions. When away from the Ark, your decisions can result in the life or death of not only your ship but of your crew.
