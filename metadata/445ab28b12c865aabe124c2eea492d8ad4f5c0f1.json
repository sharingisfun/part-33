I managed to snag it before Notch took it down.\n\nIt is described as a testbed for the DCPU emulation that will eventually appear in the &quot;game&quot;.\n\nThis is not a runnable game, just merely a .jar with bits of code and some rough screencaps. It's good for snooping around and seeing Notch's messy source code.\n\nHowever, this is the &quot;GAME&quot; that the fat greedy neckbeard already wants you to pay monthly for.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:445ab28b12c865aabe124c2eea492d8ad4f5c0f1","amp;dn":"0x10c+The+Notch+Space+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"445ab28b12c865aabe124c2eea492d8ad4f5c0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,90,178,139,18,200,101,170,190,18,76,46,234,73,45,138,212,245,192,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
