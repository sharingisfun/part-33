I gave up searching some time ago. Everywhere there were\n\nplenty of downloads of The Mill on the Floss in book form but no 1978 movie version.\n\nBut through the good offices of Mr. Alex_Riabinin, I was steered to a distant copy.\n\nAfter downloading it and sampling it I was undecided whether to send it out in an \n\nupload. The two problems were/are: 1) it is primarily in the Russian language and 2)\n\nthere are no subtitles. These disadvantages alone were enough to stop me short. My\n\nwife and I are pretty dependent on subtitles unless the quality of the movie is high \n\nwith clear, distinct speech. The presence of English as a second audio track is easy\n\nenough to manage but is a disadvantage. I use VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/)\n\nas the player: right-click on the picture and follow AUDIO to select track 2. Since\n\nI am not enthusiastic I'm not working at how to use other players and how to keep it\n\npermanent \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d438119346ec070fea413d0390d5488e4f2071c","amp;dn":"The+Mill+on+the+Floss+%281978%29+BBC+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d438119346ec070fea413d0390d5488e4f2071c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,67,129,25,52,110,192,112,254,164,19,208,57,13,84,136,228,242,7,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
