His first recording was 'Love Is A Message' for producer Bunny Lee when he was eight years old, which was followed by 'A-Class Girl' for the Black Solidarity label, which was co-run by Palmer and Ossie Thomas.  He came to the attention of producer/deejay Jah Thomas, who began a substantial association with Palmer with the track 'Entertainment', when Palmer was aged around 14. He made a major breakthrough with his performance in 1979 at the General Penitentiary Memorial Concert for Claudie Massop, which also featured Bob Marley.
