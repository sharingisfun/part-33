As a result the download could not be completed.\n\nThis version (hopefully) corrects this.\n\n\nThe hash has changed, so this is a different torrent. But only the affected file has been replaced. So save the files from the first version of the torrent and download over top to save time.\n\nVery sorry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb3c61d2b8dff309a06442c5bfb13b4513bda5a8","amp;dn":"Townes+Van+Zandt+-+2001+-+Live+At+McCabe%27s+%5BLAME+V2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb3c61d2b8dff309a06442c5bfb13b4513bda5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,60,97,210,184,223,243,9,160,100,66,197,191,177,59,69,19,189,165,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
