The band was formed when &quot;Brandon and Austin decided to start jamming together.&quot; The band's ultimate goal was to &quot;be heavier than most bands in their area,&quot; while &quot;bringing huge, poppy choruses to a genre that can become pretty stale.&quot; Originally, drummer Alex Massey filled the drumming position in the band, but he was soon replaced by their current drummer, Brent Taddie in May 2011. During 2011, the members of CTE also held an extensive search for another guitarist to join their band. They soon welcomed Bennett Vogelman (Benn Suede) to the band as the new lead guitarist.\n\nThe band started recording their debut EP, Limitless, in 2011. Limitless was released on iTunes on November 29, 2011. It featured Denis Shaforostov of former Make Me Famous renown on the title track of the album and was well received by the metalcore community.[citation needed]\n\nOn December 5, 2011 the band released a behind the scenes look at the filming for the band's upcoming music video for their song, &quot;Voices&quot;, from their recently released EP &quot;Limitless&quot;.

The tour will last from March 3rd through 7th beginning in Arizona and ending in Arkansas.\n\nOn March 21, 2012 the band was rumored to have been signed by Rise Records after the label posted this statement on their Facebook page, &quot;WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re announcing a new band on Friday. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hint, they are from Texas!&quot;. Shortly after Crown the Empire posted a statement of their own, &quot;Big News coming by the end of the week.
