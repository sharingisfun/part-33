Cebar recorded the album\n following a successful Kickstarter campaign and released \nit this year via Groovesburg Joys Records. Critics have likened \nit to Los Lobos and Tom Waits, though Cebar's sound is not\n an easy one to fit neatly in a package. Rather, it's a \nlive taste of all sorts of music designed to make you move. \n\nPLEASE BUY HIS NEW CD\nRecent Release: Fine Rude Thing\n Release Date: 2014\n Label: Groovesburg Joys\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b81c9b18b79a46e9160e5e77f8e90b159d40771","amp;dn":"Paul+Cebar+Tomorrow+Sound+live+at+World+Cafe+Live+Philadelphia+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b81c9b18b79a46e9160e5e77f8e90b159d40771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,129,201,177,139,121,164,110,145,96,229,231,127,142,144,177,89,212,7,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
