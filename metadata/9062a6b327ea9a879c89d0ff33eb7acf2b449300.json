The fourth Fearless Books edition features revised material throughout, including expanded instructions for the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven Steps of ForgivenessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ devised by author D. Patrick Miller, based on more than two decades of studying and practicing the principles of forgiveness in his own life. The 20th Year Edition is now in preparation for release this spring, and can be advance-ordered at the new price of $9.95, with free Mail Media shipping within the US direct from Fearless.\n\n&quot;I think many people mistake forgiveness as a way to avoid conflict or let people off the hook, &quot; says Miller. &quot;The kind of forgiveness I am talking about is a daily discipline of learning to see things differently, which enables you to respond to challenges with clarity, compassion, and ingenuity. If you really want to change things and have a lasting effect on people, forgiveness is a better strategy than anything else.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nINCLUDED IN THIS EDITION:\n\n* Foreword by Frederic Luskin, Ph.D., founder of the Stanford Forgiveness Projects\n* 20th Year Introduction by D.
