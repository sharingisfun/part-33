Though both are down on their luck, they dress affluently and that is what attracts them to each other. Romantic sparks fly until they learn the truth about each other. This leads Dietrich to begin an affair with a rich American widower. His teenage daughter falls for De Sica but he feels himself too old for her and rejects her. Eventually Dietrich and the American decide to marry, but before the wedding takes place, De Sica has a major winning streak. But being an addict, he does not know when to stop and begins losing again. Fortunately, his valet intervenes by knocking him unconscious. Later, when he awakens, De Sica vows that he will never gamble again and prepares to go home to his native Naples. When Dietrich learns this she is distraught and realizing she cannot marry the Yankee, tells him the truth about her feelings for De Sica thereby freeing herself to follow him.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049520/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049520/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:36:49\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x304 2.37:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1287 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,25 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks\n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82533997dd402c8ea3b46b15eb8294e9a5d7892f","amp;dn":"The+Monte+Carlo+story+%281957%29+Marlene+Dietrich+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82533997dd402c8ea3b46b15eb8294e9a5d7892f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,83,57,151,221,64,44,142,163,180,107,21,235,130,148,233,165,215,137,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
