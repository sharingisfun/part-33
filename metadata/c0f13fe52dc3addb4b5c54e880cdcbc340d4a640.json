Picturing Chinatown contains more than 160 photographs and paintings, some well known and many never reproduced before, to illustrate how this famous district has acted on the photographic and painterly imagination. Bringing together art history and the social and political history of San Francisco, this vividly detailed study unravels the complex cultural encounter that occurred between the women and men living in Chinatown and the artists who walked its streets, observed its commerce, and visited its nightclubs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f13fe52dc3addb4b5c54e880cdcbc340d4a640","amp;dn":"Picturing+Chinatown+-+Art+and+orientalism+in+San+Francisco+%28Phot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f13fe52dc3addb4b5c54e880cdcbc340d4a640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,241,63,229,45,195,173,219,75,92,84,232,128,205,203,195,64,212,166,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
