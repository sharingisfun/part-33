Featuring vocalist Chuck Billy, guitar virtuosos Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, bassist Greg Christian, and original drummer Louie Clemente (along with Testament &amp; White Zombie alumnus John Tempesta as a second drummer), the band rips through classic Testament fan favorites in this show, shot in London earlier in 2005.\nAmong the leaders of heavy metal over the past twenty years, Testament have always provided the rock solid proof that great song writing, regardless of genre, will always transcend time. Their crucial contributions to the early thrash metal surge of the mid to late 1980s helped to develop a sound that forever changed the face of heavy music and resonates just as loudly today. With all of their Bay Area peers either calling it a day or drastically altering their sound, Testament has remained a worldwide metal ambassador throughout the 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and into the new century.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
