Warren Gatland's Welsh side ran in nine unanswered tries when the sides last met at the 2011 World Cup, avenging a shock defeat at the previous tournament four years earlier. However, Wales struggled in the two most recent autumn internationals against the Pacific Islanders in Cardiff, being held to a draw in 2010 and only winning by a point in 2005. Eddie Butler, Philip Matthews and Martyn Williams provide the commentary.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 9.45 GB\nRuntime___: 148 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps ~8228Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 192Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\nAudio#2___: MP2 256Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\n\nDropbox folder:\nt i n y u r l . c o m / m s z 9 q 9 a\n\nA smaller 720p version is available from the BBC site using get_iplayer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4a3024256ee03ace6536f702475c02192aadab2","amp;dn":"BBC.Rugby.Union.2014.11.15.Wales.v.Fiji.1080ip.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4a3024256ee03ace6536f702475c02192aadab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,163,2,66,86,238,3,172,230,83,111,112,36,117,192,33,146,170,218,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
