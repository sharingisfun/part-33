I'm sure \nit's the start of what's called 'laser rot' which is why I made \na DVD of it before it got worse. The video is perfectly watchable, \nthough, so please forgive the audio flaws. \n\nCredit goes to kealkeal from Demonoid for the rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:943158759d88f609d7a686fbc768b51c23ce0e98","amp;dn":"Andy+Warhol%5C%27s+Bad+%281977%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"943158759d88f609d7a686fbc768b51c23ce0e98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,49,88,117,157,136,246,9,215,166,134,251,199,104,181,28,35,206,14,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
