If you are a system administrator and users of your network often forget to log off before leaving, ActiveExit can save you quite a bit of the nerve cells. Even if the user has locked the computer, ActiveExit can log the user off after the idle period you specify, without your intervention.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: http://www.winability.com/active-exit/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0138ac079bbcac318ab138739f2a2d6c4e2100","amp;dn":"WinAbility+Active+Exit+v15.8.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb0138ac079bbcac318ab138739f2a2d6c4e2100","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,1,56,172,7,155,188,172,49,138,177,56,115,159,42,45,108,78,33,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
