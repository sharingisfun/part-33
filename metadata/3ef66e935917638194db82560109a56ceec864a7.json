In the second half of the show Max talks to David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5000 Years, about weaponized debt and the origins of May Day.        \n\nMax is a very intelligent, generallt well-informed guy but there are significant places where we disagree: peak oil, man-made global warning, and guns to name a few. In a rant about guns in this episode he actually says Obama is the most NRA-friendly figure since Charlton Heston.\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
