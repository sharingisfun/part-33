The band released four studio albums and one live set during its run. Among their best-known songs are &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Queens of Noise&quot; and a cover version of the Velvet UndergroundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. The Runaways, though never a major success in the United States, became a sensation overseas, e.g. in Japan, thanks to the hit single &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot;.\nJoan Jett\n\nJett went on to become a partner and work with producer and former Shondell Kenny Laguna. After being rejected by 23 record labels, they formed their own label, Blackheart Records, in 1980. In doing so, Jett became one of the first female recording artists to found her own record label. The label continues to release albums by the Blackhearts, and also other new up and coming bands. Jett went on to have massive success with a cover of the Arrows' song &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, as well as other hits such as &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; and &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You&quot;. Jett also co-starred in the 1987 film Light of Day with Michael J. Fox, and appeared in the 2000 Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Show as Columbia. Jett is also on Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. She still continues playing to this day and is still touring all over the world. She recently released a new studio album called Unvarnished which charted number 47 on U.S. charts.\n\nÃÂ¡ategory: Music\nYear: 1981\nStyle: Hard Rock\nAdditional: Glam Rock\nCountry: USA\nFormat: 320 mp3\nSize: 80.92 MB\n\nAdded: 2015-04-08\nFiles: 10\n\nDescription:\nLength: 00:35:19\n\nTracks :\n01.
