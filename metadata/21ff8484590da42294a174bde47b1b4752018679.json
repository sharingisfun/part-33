Pritha has been brought up in a Church headed by a dedicated Father played here by Victor Banerjee. By profession Pritha is a nurse. But she is victim of a peculiar disease. The disease is psychic. Whenever she looks at the Indian national flag or\nwatches any patriotic film or be it the Indian Independence day she is attacked by her disease of unconsciousness. Several doctors have checked her but were unable to diagnos her disease.\nA young FRCS doctor Anindya (Saswata Chatterjee) comes into the story. Then the story took a different turn along with the deepening complexity of Pritha. One day suddenly Pritha attacks Anindya with a knife while she was assisting him in operation theatre. Anindya became astonished at the suddenness of that peculiar incident. But gradually he recovered and began his quest to find out the origin of her disease. This consultancy reveals some interesting incidents related to Pritha and her past life that has a close connection with the freedom struggle of India. This search also brought these two young personalities closer in their personal life.\nRef: http://www.astrainfotech.org/kolkatainformation/archive/aba-asbo.html\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/q5o0bkvk3/14_28_59_vcd_aabar_asbo_phire.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/q5o0bkvk3/14_28_59_vcd_aabar_asbo_phire.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVCD bought from Induna.com (in 2 CDs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.induna.com/1000011419-productdetails/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.induna.com/1000011419-productdetails/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/lxt82tu4j/snaps_1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/lxt82tu4j/snaps_1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/exaa75yo3/snaps_2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/exaa75yo3/snaps_2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/5e0ldpb5v/snaps_3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/5e0ldpb5v/snaps_3.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/rai2gyi0z/snaps_4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/rai2gyi0z/snaps_4.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/8v2ngoa83/snaps_5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s19.postimg.org/8v2ngoa83/snaps_5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy Verdict:\nMovie and its songs are quite good but the video quality of the original VCD is bad, audio is average. It may seem like a Cam rip but actually the DAT files are copied from the original VCD.\n\nDAT file is playable in any media player including Windows Media Player, VLC etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ff8484590da42294a174bde47b1b4752018679","amp;dn":"Abar+Asbo+Phire+%282004%29+2+CD-VCD-DAT....nomalware","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ff8484590da42294a174bde47b1b4752018679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,255,132,132,89,13,164,34,148,161,116,189,228,123,27,71,82,1,134,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
