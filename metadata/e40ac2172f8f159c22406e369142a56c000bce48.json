The Vault Dweller (from now on referred to as Kelly) was your character's direct ancestor, two generations ago. Kelly, after saving the world (Southern California) from Evil (mutants), was banished from Vault 13 by the overseer that called for the mission in the first place. Kelly, after being banished, assembled a group of travelers and nomads to roam far from Vault 13, to start an agricultural settlement, this time, in Northern California. There, Kelly found a significant other, a person named Pat, and began to procreate. Two generations later, your character was born, direct grandchild of the original Vault Dweller. The conflict? Kelly's legends spoke of a holy artifact, the G.E.C.K., that could turn deserted wasteland into a lush, green paradise, hence the name, Garden of Eden Creation Kit.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\nMac OS X version 10.1.4 or higher\n233MHz PowerPC G3 processor or higher\n128MB of Memory\n600MB of hard disk space\n\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.apple.com/games/articles/2002/09/fallout2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.apple.com/games/articles/2002/09/fallout2/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40ac2172f8f159c22406e369142a56c000bce48","amp;dn":"Fallout+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40ac2172f8f159c22406e369142a56c000bce48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,10,194,23,47,143,21,156,34,64,110,54,145,66,165,108,0,11,206,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
