I've never really decided how I feel about it. But then my father isn't a famous underground comic book artist who died too young, either.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lizard of Oz\n\nMark Bode and Vaughn Bode\n\nFantagraphics, The Bode Library, 2004, 56 pages\n\nVaughn BodÃƒÂ©'s son delivers his father's magnum opus.\n\nBack in the 1960s and 1970s, underground comix superstar Vaughn Bode fathered an entire world of wonderful characters, including Cheech Wizard, the belligerent &quot;cartoon gooroo&quot;; his trademark naive lizards and buxom &quot;BodÃƒÂ© babes&quot;; eccentric robots; and much, much more. Tragically, BodÃƒÂ©'s premature death in 1975 deprived his loyal readers of reading any further adventures of these marvelously unique creations...until now.\n\nWorking from ideas developed by Vaughn BodÃƒÂ© right before his death, his son Mark has re-enlisted his father's entire cast of characters for The Lizard of Oz, a full-color graphic novel that pays playful homage to and parodies the classic L. Frank Baum fairy tale (and its beloved film adaptation). Mark's graphic style perfectly duplicates and extends BodÃƒÂ©'s unique, lush, brilliantly colorful, pillowy graphic approach that has made him, even a quarter century after his death, a profound inspiration on several generations of cartoonists and graffiti artists.\n\nBlessed with an original full-color wraparound cover by Vaughn BodÃƒÂ© (one of his last completed works), augmented with a long introduction by BodÃƒÂ© expert and Paper magazine contributor Carlo McCormick that explores the legacies of both BodÃƒÂ© and Oz creator L. Frank Baum, as well as with a sketchbook of Mark's preparatory work for this ambitious book, The Lizard of Oz is one last book-length romp with a group of fictional old friends and a witty tip of the magician's hat to a classic of fantasy literature.
