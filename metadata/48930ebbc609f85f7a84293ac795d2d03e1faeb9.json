Jimmy Page's riffs rely on ringing, folky hooks as much as they do on thundering blues-rock, giving the album a lighter, more open atmosphere. While the pseudo-reggae of &quot;D'Yer Mak'er&quot; and the affectionate James Brown send-up &quot;The Crunge&quot; suggest that the band was searching for material, they actually contribute to the musical diversity of the album. &quot;The Rain Song&quot; is one of Zep's finest moments, featuring a soaring string arrangement and a gentle, aching melody. &quot;The Ocean&quot; is just as good, starting with a heavy, funky guitar groove before slamming into an a cappella section and ending with a swinging, doo wop-flavored rave-up. With the exception of the rampaging opening number, &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; the rest of Houses of the Holy is fairly straightforward, ranging from the foreboding &quot;No Quarter&quot; and the strutting hard rock of &quot;Dancing Days&quot; to the epic folk/metal fusion &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away.&quot; Throughout the record, the band's playing is excellent, making the eclecticism of Page and Robert Plant's songwriting sound coherent and natural.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48930ebbc609f85f7a84293ac795d2d03e1faeb9","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+Houses+of+the+Holy+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48930ebbc609f85f7a84293ac795d2d03e1faeb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,147,14,187,198,9,248,95,122,132,41,58,199,149,210,208,62,31,174,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
