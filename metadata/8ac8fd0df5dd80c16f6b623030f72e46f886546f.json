It was released in 1973. The album was the first of many times the band worked with Terry Manning as engineer. It was a successful combination as the release was the band's first commercial breakthrough. In the US, the album entered the top ten while the single &quot;La Grange&quot; reached number 41 on the singles charts. (Meanwhile, &quot;La Grange&quot; debuted number 33 on the American Top 40 broadcast on June 29, 1974.)\n\nAt the height of ZZ Top's success in the mid-1980s a digitally remixed version of the recording was released on CD and the original 1973 mix version was discontinued. The remix version created controversy among fans because it significantly changed the sound of the instruments, especially drums. The remix version was used on all early CD copies and was the only version available for over 20 years. A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on February 28, 2006, which contains three bonus live tracks. The 2006 edition is the first CD version to use Manning's original 1973 mix.\n\nFLAC\n\nZZ Top\n\nTres Hombres\n\n1973\n\nVinyl - No Artwork\n\n&quot;Waitin' for the Bus&quot; Ã‚Â \tBilly Gibbons, Dusty Hill\t2:59\t\n&quot;Jesus Just Left Chicago&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons, Hill, Frank Beard\t3:30\n&quot;Beer Drinkers &amp; Hell Raisers&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons, Hill, Beard\t3:23\n&quot;Master of Sparks&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons\t3:33\n&quot;Hot, Blue and Righteous&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons\t3:14\n&quot;Move Me on Down the Line&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons, Hill\t2:32\n&quot;Precious and Grace&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons, Hill, Beard\t3:09\n&quot;La Grange&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons, Hill, Beard\t3:52\n&quot;Shiek&quot; Ã‚Â \tGibbons, Hill\t4:05\n&quot;Have You Heard?&quot; Ã‚Â ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac8fd0df5dd80c16f6b623030f72e46f886546f","amp;dn":"ZZ+Top+-+Tres+Hombres+%28Vinyl+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac8fd0df5dd80c16f6b623030f72e46f886546f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,200,253,13,245,221,128,193,111,107,98,48,48,247,46,70,248,134,84,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
