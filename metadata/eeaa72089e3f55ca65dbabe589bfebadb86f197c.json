The contributions are as varied as the personalities of active mathematicians, but together they show mathematics as a rich and lively field of research. The contributions are written for interested students at the age of transition between high school and university who know high school mathematics and perhaps competition mathematics and who want to find out what current research mathematics is about. We hope that it will also be of interest to teachers or more advanced mathematicians who would like to learn about exciting aspects of mathematics outside of their own work or specialization. Together with a team of young ``test readers'', editors and authors have taken great care, through a substantial ``active editing'' process, to make the contributions understandable by the intended readership.\n\n244 pages \nPublisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (June 29, 2011) \nLanguage: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeaa72089e3f55ca65dbabe589bfebadb86f197c","amp;dn":"An+Invitation+To+Mathematics+From+Competitions+to+Research","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeaa72089e3f55ca65dbabe589bfebadb86f197c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,170,114,8,158,63,85,202,101,219,171,229,137,191,235,173,184,111,25,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
