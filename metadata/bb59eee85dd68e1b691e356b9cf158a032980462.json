Beth (Christina          \n             Ricci) and Jody (Anna Chlumsky) couldn't be         \n            more different. Beth is a city girl who has         \n           just moved from Los Angeles to a small town       \n              in the Pacific Northwest: Jody is a rough-         \n                and-rumble tomboy who's right at home in the\n                woods and lakes surrounding her hometown.\n                Together they trace the decades-old legend\n                of Molly Morgan, who may have stashed a\n                fortune in gold in the labyrinth of caves\n                in Bear Mountain. Climaxing in a hair-raising \n                chase in the spooky mountain caverns, it's\n                a 24-karat tale that sparkles with humor,\n                warmth and breathtaking excitement.\n\n\n                                                              \n                                                   \n                             \n                                      \n                            -+ Rip Notes +-                      \n                                                              \n\n                   Two years ago we gave you a Laserdisc\n                 rip of this 90s Disneyish kids classic.\n                 Now that Universal has been kind enough\n                 to offer it as a print-on-demand DVDR in\n                 their Vault series, we're of course\n                 bringing you an updated DVDRip.\n\n                   Gold Diggers seems on the surface to be\n                 your typical kids-go-on-a-wild-adventure\n                 type of film, but it has something to offer\n                 that most other titles from this genre\n                 don't: Christina Ricci and Anna Chlumsky.\n                 For those who don't remember Anna, she's\n                 the girl you had a crush on when you were\n            a kid and just finished watching My Girl.         \n             Here she plays a tomboy with terrible hair,         \n               and this time it's not her mom who's dead,           \n               but rather Christina's dad. In the end              \n              this movie is more about the developing            \n           friendship between the two girls than it           \n           is about gold or treasure maps, but                  \n              there's still plenty of adventure to go                 \n               around.                                             \n                       Enjoy!!                                    \n                                                               \n                                            \n                                                 \n                      -+ Who We Are +-                  \n                                                                   \n                                                                    \n            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-          \n           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment             \n            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                \n          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless             \n             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had             \n              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special\n              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their\n              many tools.\n\n                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better\n              days, we seek to relive those times, and share\n              those memories. While our belief is that the\n              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,\n              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or\n              any single genre. We will not ignore the movies\n              considered insignificant or even embarrassing by\n              the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece\n              just because it is dated.\n\n                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital\n              sources, there are still thousands of rare and\n              out of print titles, many of which have no\n              planned digital release. We've made it our\n              mission to dig these out, clean them up using\n              the best hardware and techniques available to\n              us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS,\n              Laserdisc or more exotic formats, we're here\n              to bring you the best (and worst!) of decades\n           past. So sit back and enjoy as we uncover and             \n           pay tribute to an age of cinema we will never           \n         get back.                                               \n                                                                     \n                                                               \n                                                     \n                                     \n                                                 \n                                                 \n                           -+  Respect  +-                  \n                                                            \n                                                                \n                  AEN  AEROHOLiCS  ALLiANCE  ARTHOUSE           \n                                                                \n                 BLooDLiTE  BLooDWeiSeR  EPiSODE  FiCO          \n                                                                \n               FLS  FRAGMENT  HkM  HUMANiSM  KYR  MEMETiC       \n                                                                 \n              QiX  SAPHiRE  TheWretched  VH-PROD  VoMiT  xV      \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                 Gone But Not Forgotten         \n                                                                 \n                  SiCK  Cheetah-TV  CuNT  TCF  SChiZO            \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                   and everyone who truly contributes            \n                                                                 \n                                                              \n       \n                                             \n                  ascii: asphyx!LGF!CPH!SAC!ACiD 2002","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb59eee85dd68e1b691e356b9cf158a032980462","amp;dn":"Gold.Diggers.The.Secret.of.Bear.Mountain.1995.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb59eee85dd68e1b691e356b9cf158a032980462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,89,238,232,93,214,142,27,105,30,53,107,156,241,88,160,50,152,4,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
