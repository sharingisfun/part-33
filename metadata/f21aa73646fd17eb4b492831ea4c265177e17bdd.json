Throughout, listeners are treated to Dupree's thundering barrelhouse piano, his Emerald City vocals (always delivered, it seems, with a slight wink), and a solid and rocking backing band. Highlights include &quot;Ain't It a Shame&quot; and &quot;Down the Valley&quot;, great songs .\n\nrec. London Feb. 1966\n\n1.: Third Degree\n2.: T.V.
