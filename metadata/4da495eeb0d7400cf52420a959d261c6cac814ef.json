The author developed a detailed model of civilization life cycle analysis. According to him, civilizations pass through 7 predictable stages. Typically the 7th and last stage of one civilization is the first stage of another one that is succeeding the first dying civilization. \n\nUsing his model, he analyzes in detail the life cycle of several major civilizations, including: the Mesopotamian, Minoan, Classical, Russian, and Western.\n\nReading this book almost feels like uncovering a manuscript of secret knowledge. Although I have read quite a bit on this subject, other historians and authors rarely refer to Quigley. Yet, I feel that he is the giant within his field of historical analysis. And, that his model could serve well in better understanding current affairs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da495eeb0d7400cf52420a959d261c6cac814ef","amp;dn":"Carroll+Quigley+-+The+Evolution+of+Civilizations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da495eeb0d7400cf52420a959d261c6cac814ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,164,149,238,176,215,64,12,245,36,32,169,89,210,97,198,202,200,20,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
