Whether it's animals behaving oddly or even the planet that perplexes, each episode sees scientists studying baffling phenomena in a bid to understand what Mother Nature's really up to. The reasons behind incidents will vary, but there's one conclusion that we always reach: the world isn't as predictable as we'd like to think.\n\n\n\nEpisode 3 : The Bodiless Bear\n\nThis programme looks at a series of brutal attacks on black bears in Yellowstone Park, including the extraordinary case of a severed bear head. In 1990, whilst hiking through Yellowstone National Park, bear expert Dr David Mattson came across a most hideous and unbelievable sight: the severed head of a black bear. The case of the bodiless bear, and three subsequent bear slayings, would go on to shed new light on what scientists understand about bears and their habitat.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2087 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:19.720\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 825 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29b539b6ad7a5feefbd2ff530521e195b7da9e7","amp;dn":"Ch5.Nature.Shock.3of8.The.Bodiless.Bear.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29b539b6ad7a5feefbd2ff530521e195b7da9e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,155,83,155,106,215,165,254,239,189,47,245,48,82,30,25,91,125,169,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
