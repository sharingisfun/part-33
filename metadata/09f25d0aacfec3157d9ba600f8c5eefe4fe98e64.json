This way, noone else will have to =) You can finally put your Suiko1 PAL savefile to use. \n\nFixed from the US/NTSC version:\n* Loading a previous gamefile no longer jarbles the old names (TcDohl and such)\n* Annallee actually sings in this one\n* Several music bugs fixed\n* Gibberish-spewing NPC's make sense again. \nThis is all according to user reports. Typos are still plentiful though. \n\nThis is my first torrent ever uploaded, so here's hoping it turns out well. The imagefile has been tested for the first 10 minutes on ePSXe, so there shouldn't be any problems.\n\n\n\nPS! You can ONLY use the &quot;Load previous gamefile&quot; feature with a save from the PAL-version of Suikoden 1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f25d0aacfec3157d9ba600f8c5eefe4fe98e64","amp;dn":"Suikoden+II+PAL+%28PSX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f25d0aacfec3157d9ba600f8c5eefe4fe98e64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,242,93,10,172,254,195,21,125,155,166,0,248,197,238,254,79,233,142,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
