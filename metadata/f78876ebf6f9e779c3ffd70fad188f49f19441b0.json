Standing somewhere between Motorhead, Maiden and Mercyful Fate sonically, the Fist quartet possessed more songwriting chops than most, while also elevating these tracks with a heaping dose of energy and innocent, fire-driven aggression. \n\nAs a result, Turn the Hell On is an up-and-down joyride of vintage metal composition, taking great care in making sure each melodic elementÃ¢â‚¬â€whether vocal or stringÃ¢â‚¬â€is counterbalanced by an equal feeling of devil-may-care swagger. \n\n\n01.
