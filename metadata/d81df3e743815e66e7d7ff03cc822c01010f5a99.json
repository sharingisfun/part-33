Haas\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nThe author relates the exploits of the US Air ForceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unconventional warriors who flew and fought for over a quarter of a century in a shadowy war that was out of the public eye. He uses interviews and recently declassified sources to describe the bravery and resourcefulness of these warriors in 26 chapters, or stories, arranged in three sections: (1) Korea, (2) Covert War, and (3) the Second Indochina War. To add to the attractiveness of this publication are over 200 color and black-and-white photographs depicting people and activities involved in this little-known aspect of the cold war. \nHaas has an unbeatable book on Air Force Special Operations. This book covers the periods from WWII with high lights about the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, forerunner to the CIA and Green Berets) onto Korea covering air missions on psychological operations and support efforts, rolling into the late 50s early 60s coving various clandestine and covert operations, like the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bay of PigsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Haas then picks up with the 2nd Indochina war starting in the early 60s with Laos wrapping it up the Vietnam section with the Son Tay Raid. This book also covers Medal of Honor winners and other heroes and personalities of Air Force special operations. The book has an index and bibliography.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d81df3e743815e66e7d7ff03cc822c01010f5a99","amp;dn":"Apollo%27s+Warriors%3A+US+Air+Force+Special+Operations+During+the+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d81df3e743815e66e7d7ff03cc822c01010f5a99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,29,243,231,67,129,94,102,231,215,255,3,204,130,44,1,1,15,90,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
