Taking on Showtek and Justin PrimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocal edit of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cannonball,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the British producer crafts a remix which uses almost zero elements of the original. The smash hitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s familiar plateau is replaced by a driving bassline leading to delicate synths before Mathew KomaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infectious vocals provide sing-along appeal. Despite being released over a year ago, Ã¢â‚¬Å“CannonballÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is still a staple in many sets today and KryderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remix will extend the life of the anthem mix even longer.\n\nBit rate: 320KBPS\n\nSize: 11.4MB\n\nSEED &amp; ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58dce7fb5e2c87fd862ba9903165719d5d022fc9","amp;dn":"Showtek+%26amp%3B+Justin+Prime+Feat+Matthew+Koma+-+Cannonball+%28Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58dce7fb5e2c87fd862ba9903165719d5d022fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,220,231,251,94,44,135,253,134,43,169,144,49,101,113,157,93,2,47,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
