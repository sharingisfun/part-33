Most of the word problem is\nalready supplied, except for a few key words and\nnumbers that have been removed and replaced with\nblanks. It is up to students to fill in those blanks with\nmissing nouns, verbs, and adjectivesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just as they\nwould in other word games. The difference is that\nthis game is missing some numbers as well. When\nyour students supply the missing numbers along\nwith the words, you suddenly have a wacky math\nword problem that is fun to read and solve!\n\nThis ebook is for grades 4 - 6.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae79fdd7553f9337615eeb228a676dd7d4f59368","amp;dn":"50+Fill-in+Math+Word+Problems+-+Gr+4-6.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae79fdd7553f9337615eeb228a676dd7d4f59368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,121,253,215,85,63,147,55,97,94,235,34,138,103,109,215,212,245,147,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
