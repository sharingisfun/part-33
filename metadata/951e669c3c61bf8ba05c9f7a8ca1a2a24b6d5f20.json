This is Chapter one. It is written by me and made only for the torrent world. You will not find this as a published book but only as an independent effort for torrenting. Please do seed this, and once it has enough seeds I will do Chapter 2. It is epub format, and is 9.84kb. It has 4 peoples perspective on the infestation of Day one April 2nd 2014. Comments are welcome and appreciated. It is a bit gory and has cussing as any good zombie novel should.
