But Disturbed held their own from the start, so get up, come on get down with the sickness. If 2002's Believe downplayed  Draiman's guttural responses a little, that tact's long gone for 2005's Ten Thousand Fists. From Todd McFarlane's evocative wronged misfits artwork -- Suicide Girls stand fists upraised next to ghoulish fiends and disenfranchised truckers -- to the rousing staccato of the title track and the &quot;Sickness&quot; rewrite &quot;Stricken,&quot; Disturbed solidify their stance as the black knights of gaming-console rock. Creepy electronics slither behind Dan Donegan's guitar, and he mostly forsakes soloing to concentrate on the visceral groove. \n\nWhen he's not hacking like a chained-up pit bull, Draiman emotes from the valley of reverb (that's next to the valley of death), and his moments of epic roar make the songs' choppier parts more effective. Now, &quot;Overburdened&quot; takes the epic stuff a little too far. Draiman starts off the song in narration, muttering &quot;Fate is so unkind&quot; like a monster who's been given the power to feel. But even in its swirling pretentiousness, you can't deny his intensity. Luckily the majority of \n Fists sticks to mid-tempo punishers that pound back anger-gritted teeth and no \n anesthesia. (Remember, Disturbed's tours are underwritten by JÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â£germeister, the black licorice firewater that punches Saturday night in the face.) &quot;Deify&quot; rails against blind devotion to political leaders and &quot;Sons of Plunder&quot; stalks at a faster, more aggressive faster heart rate, while &quot;Decadence&quot; and &quot;Sacred Lie&quot; drop into the rhythmic grip that by mid- to late album is almost comfortable in its gloomy thump. \n \n(Disturbed's ill-advised cover of Genesis' &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;? No comment.) Ten \n Thousand Fists does start to sound the same after a while. But those bloody zombies aren't going to stop pouring though the doorway, so it's a good thing it has at least 12 burly alt-metal rockers.
