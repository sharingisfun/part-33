Fate saw the family move next door to blues great Lonnie Johnson, whose complex riffs caught young Louis's ear. Another Myers brother, harp-blowing Bob, hooked Louis up with guitarist Othum Brown for house party gigs. Myers also played with guitarist Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Spires before teaming with his brother David on guitar and young harpist Junior Wells to form the first incarnation of the Aces (who were initially known as the Three Deuces). In 1950, drummer Fred Below came on board.\n\nIn effect, the Aces and Muddy Waters traded harpists in 1952, Wells leaving to play with Waters while Little Walter, just breaking nationally with his classic &quot;Juke,&quot; moved into the front man role with the Aces. Myers and the Aces backed Walter on his seminal &quot;Mean Old World,&quot; &quot;Sad Hours,&quot; &quot;Off the Wall,&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Mama&quot; and at New York's famous Apollo Theater before Louis left in 1954 (he and the Aces moonlighted on Wells's indispensable 1953-54 output for States).\n\nPlenty of sideman work awaited Myers -- he played with Otis Rush, Earl Hooker, and many more. But his own recording career was practically non-existent; after a solitary 1956 single for Abco, &quot;Just Whaling&quot;/&quot;Bluesy,&quot; that found Myers blowing harp in Walter-like style, it wasn't until 1968 that two Myers tracks turned up on Delmark.\n\nThe Aces reformed during the 1970s and visited Europe often as a trusty rhythm section for touring acts. Myers cut a fine set for Advent in 1978, I'm a Southern Man, that showed just how effective he could be as a leader (in front of an L.A. band, no less). Myers was hampered by the effects of a stroke while recording his last album for Earwig, 1991's Tell My Story Movin'. He courageously completed the disc but was limited to playing harp only. His health soon took a turn for the worse, ending his distinguished musical career. ~ Bill Dahl, \n\n\nTracklist\n1. I'm A Southern Man - 3:59 \n2. Short Haired Woman - 5:19 \n3.
