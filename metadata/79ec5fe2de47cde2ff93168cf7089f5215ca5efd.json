Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate metadata and pagination, etc.\n\n\ndescription:\n\n&quot;Thirty-five years ago few could have predicted that The New Science of Politics would be a best-seller by political theory standards. Compressed within the Draconian economy of the six Walgreen lectures is a complete theory of man, society, and history, presented at the most profound and intellectual level. . . . Voegelin's [work] stands out in bold relief from much of what has passed under the name of political science in recent decades. . . . The New Science is aptly titled, for Voegelin makes clear at the outset that a 'return to the specific content' of premodern political theory is out of the question. . . . The subtitle of the book, An Introduction, clearly indicates that The New Science of Politics is an invitation to join the search for the recovery of our full humanity.&quot; - From the new Foreword by Dante Germino\n\n&quot;This book must be considered one of the most enlightening essays on the character of European politics that has appeared in half a century. . . . This is a book powerful and vivid enough to make agreement or disagreement with even its main thesis relatively unimportant.&quot; - Times Literary Supplement \n\n&quot;Voegelin . . . is one of the most distinguished interpreters to Americans of the non-liberal streams of European thought. . . . He brings a remarkable breadth of knowledge, and a historical imagination that ranges frequently into brilliant insights and generalizations.&quot; - Francis G. Wilson, American Political Science Review \n\n&quot;This book is beautifully constructed . . . his erudition constantly brings a startling illumination.&quot; - Martin Wright, International Affairs \n\n&quot;A lodestar to thinking men who seek a restoration of political science on the classic and Christian basis . . . a significant accomplishment in the retheorization of our age.&quot; - Anthony Harrigan, Christian Century \n\nAbout the Author\n\nEric Voegelin (1901-1985) was Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution at the time of his death. He is the author of numerous books in addition to his major five-volume work Order and History.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ec5fe2de47cde2ff93168cf7089f5215ca5efd","amp;dn":"Eric+Voegelin+-+The+New+Science+of+Politics+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ec5fe2de47cde2ff93168cf7089f5215ca5efd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,236,95,226,222,71,205,226,255,147,22,140,247,8,159,82,21,202,94,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
