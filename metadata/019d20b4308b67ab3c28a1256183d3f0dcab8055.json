They are used for backing up data from optical discs and creating exact disc copies for further replication. The main advantage of disc images is that they are essentially exact sector-by-sector copies of original discs preserving both their content and structure. If you have a disc image in any format, you can easily recreate the original disc by burning the image to a blank CD, DVD or BD disc. And although this task may initially seem to be somewhat hard, proper software will make it a breeze ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ software like ISO Workshop!\n\nFeatures:\nExtract files and folders from disc image\nCopy disc to disc image (including Audio CD)\nConvert disc image to ISO or BIN format\nBurn ISO or CUE/BIN image to disc\nSupports common formats (ISO, CUE, BIN, NRG, MDF, CDI etc.)\nSupports CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW, DVD+R DL, BD-R/RE\nSupports verification of written files\nFree for personal and commercial use\n\n\nHome Page - http://www.glorylogic.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:019d20b4308b67ab3c28a1256183d3f0dcab8055","amp;dn":"ISO+Workshop+1.2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"019d20b4308b67ab3c28a1256183d3f0dcab8055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,157,32,180,48,139,103,171,60,40,161,37,97,131,211,240,220,171,128,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
