A comparison of &quot;It Happened Here&quot; with the recent television series &quot;Jericho&quot; is recommended.\n\n   A further exploration of how &quot;newsreel&quot; footage was used in the depiction of war is in &quot;The Victors&quot; (1963)  by Carl Foreman  and currently available on torrents.  For me it is quite telling the difference between what Hollywood stars did in &quot;The Victors&quot; as compared with any crop of Young Lions today.  It's not only telling, it's disheartening.  &quot;The Victors&quot; is one of the great anti-war films.\n\nNotes written November 15 2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6479c296ee9905cb61446ab30db675caf82e3b4a","amp;dn":"It+Happened+Here+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6479c296ee9905cb61446ab30db675caf82e3b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,121,194,150,238,153,5,203,97,68,106,179,13,182,117,202,248,46,59,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
