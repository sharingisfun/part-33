In providing a conscious alternative through music, the band has become a part of a movement, an unspoken yet clear message of a generation. Kultirations intent is to continue to serve and inspire people with great music.\n\nThe music of Kultiration finds inspiration in, but still transcends, both roots reggae and jazz as well as traditional Swedish folk music. Instruments like violin, accordion and double bass bring melodic depth to a steady backbeat, jazzy keys and a potent horn section. All this also resonating high together with the grounding messages and unique vocals from lead singer Marcus Berg. With a solid reputation for live shows and three studio album releases (alongside a number of dub and live albums), this nine piece orchestra has continuously proved to evolve their own sound and create new groundbreaking music witch speaks of the world today, to the people of today. Their sound can not easily be labelled as anything other than simply; Kultiration.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOm GaiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn 2003, Gothenburg Sweden, Marcus found himself gathering musicians to record what was to be the debut album of Kultiration. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOm GaiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ unleashed a raw and hungry sound straight from the analogue recordings of Studio Folkhemmet. The album filled the gap between reggae and Swedish roots music, a sound that many had been waiting for.\n\nOne year later Kultiration found themselves back in the studio with more experience as a live act and a refined sense of direction in the studio. Out came ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGrogrundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the second studio album. The listener could now hear the balance of traditional influences and roots reggae handled with delicacy. Kultiration was spreading the oneness vision, musically and spiritually. And it seemed to draw crowds from different subcultures, way beyond the more directly reggae-oriented listeners. Even world music, pop and metal fans gathered at the shows, and the family was growing.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKill the music and rebirth the musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Lee ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œScratchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Perry\n\nOn tour the group established the connection with legendary dubmaster Internal Dread at Rubadub studios, Stockholm. After a few discussions on the favourite topic, the next step was natural. While Marcus was writing new material and lived in Indonesia for a period of time, the band released their first dub album. The concept of dub also took form in a live setting, bringing old fashioned dub to the audience, live and direct! The Bands third album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶den FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶derÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (a title that indicates a contemplating thought over destruction and construction, life and death etc.) has been described as bringing as much darkness as light to the listener. Kultiration created a majestic landscape with confident and skill, holding nothing back. Words could now be heard in English as well as Swedish. The record went straight up on the Swedish album list, a stunning performance from an underground band without major PR backup or ads! A full scale Scandinavia tour followed the release, covering the summer and fall of 2007 with over 50 shows.\n\nTo deepen the depth, Kultiration released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶den FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶der DubÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on vinyl, dubbed of course, by Internal Dread who also mixed the original cuts. With overwhelmingly good reviews, two albums out and an extensive national tour in the same year, 2007 was an inspirational and successful journey for the band. The band now has a set mind and soul to continue forward and share the abundance, there is really no alternative.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever endingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nStanding firm in their own musical heritage, Kultiration music moves beyond borders with great integrity and talent to reveal the oneness behind the different influences. The name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKultirationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ stands for how ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfootprintsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of a culture expresses through the individual. Believing firmly in the strength and inspiration that comes out of music and life, Kultiration continues to gather new energy in order to deliver conscious, high-vibration performances in and outside Scandinavia.\n\nLet us all continue to share and take part of the blessings of musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\n\n\nKÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rlek och respect/Love and respect &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kultiration.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kultiration.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5b348f21a34ec110924067a9b73dd697e2e86d","amp;dn":"Kultiration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd5b348f21a34ec110924067a9b73dd697e2e86d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,91,52,143,33,163,78,193,16,146,64,103,169,183,61,214,151,226,232,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
