Good stories from Jeph Loeb, so if you're turned off thinking it's just a lousy Captain America rip-off, don't be too hasty: it's actually a pretty decent Captain America rip-off.\n\nAlso, if this is of any interest to you at all I'd recommend Alan Moore's &quot;Supreme&quot; stuff from Awesome Entertainment too.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a99d991b58c87cd7d207417a8fdaca52e713957","amp;dn":"Fighting+American+-+Awesome+Entertainment.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a99d991b58c87cd7d207417a8fdaca52e713957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,153,217,145,181,140,135,205,125,32,116,23,168,253,172,165,46,113,57,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
