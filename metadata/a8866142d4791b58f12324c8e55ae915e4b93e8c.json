A very lovely music, extremelly well played by Jobim with people like Luis Bonfa, Stan Getz, and Astrud Gilberto, that makes our souls happy for one our, and probably the rest of the day. Astrud Gilberto sings so softly and sweetly in Corcovado that the listener feels that something is making ripples in his/her chest. Stan Getz plays a counterpart tenor-sax to Jobim's deep vocals in &quot;So Danco Samba&quot; and Elis Regina makes the same with him in Aguas De Marco. If you don't buy it as soon as possible, then you are missing the BEST chance to listen to the greatest Brazilian composer of all time at his BEST moment: The Bossanova explosion of the 60's, if Jobim had a low moment after that. Which one is the best song of this brilliant CD? I bought the album two years ago and I still don't know. The entire album is just the most wonderful love song (One Hour Song, Man!). It's a shame that the rate only reachs five stars. This album deserves 10. I can't say anything but: &quot;brother, sister, buy it. You don't know what you are missing&quot;. Fascinating rhythym, Oh Won't you stop thinkin' bout me.  ~ Javier Moreno\n\nWords aren't enough to describe this album. It's an album that is an experience. Each and every song affects the emotions and soul. There are instrumentals as well as vocals, making this a great album with a mix of different Jobim styles. There's even a Gershwin tune thrown in for good measure, the only non-Jobim song on here. The booklet contains informative liner notes about Jobim, as well as notes on a few of the songs. This is a must-have for Jobim and/or bossa nova fans. ~ G.
