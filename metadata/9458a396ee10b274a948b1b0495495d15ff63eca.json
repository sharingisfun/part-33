The Music is great and different in a good way. I recommend Survivor by G Robinson.\n\nNow for Dancehall Gospel. to tell you the truth, if you ain't Jamaican,\nyou understand most words, except, and i'm going out on the limb with this: Naa Bow (translate: Not Going To Bow).\n\nBut the rhythms alone will get ya dancing and jumping all over the place (atleast it did for me lol) ENJOY and Comment.
