You play Randall Wayne, an introverted and slightly paranoid survivor searching the destroyed streets of Seattle for his loved ones. Through tense platforming and life-threatening zombie encounters you must decide whether to use scarce ammunition and weapons to decimate the horde, or navigate the environment to sneak past them and hide. Thereâ€™s more than one way to survive against the walking undead remains of the human race, now known only as â€˜shadowsâ€™. \r\nDeadlight: Directorâ€™s Cut enhances the original Deadlight in every way. Improved visuals and textures bring even more detail to the remnants of Seattle, plus enhanced controls and new animations make Randall even more agile. Now you must fight for your life and put your survival skills to the test in Deadlight: Directorâ€™s Cut new game mode, the â€˜Survival Arenaâ€™.\r\nFeatures\r\nSolve puzzles and overcome environmental hazards in tense 2D platforming\r\nDecimate zombies with melee combat and weapons, or sneak past using the environment. Combat isnâ€™t always the answer, especially when ammunition, weapons, and resources are scarce\r\nSeparated from his family, search the ruins of a â€˜1986â€™ Seattle and uncover the fate of Randallâ€™s loved ones\r\nSurvive endless waves of zombies in the new â€˜Survival Arenaâ€™ mode! Use Interactive defences to block zombies and access new areas, or fightback using new weapons like the Machine Gun, Molotov Cocktail and Sniper Rifle to rank above the rest in online-leader boards\r\nRunning at 1080p, with superior controls and new animations, this is how survival was meant to look.\r\nWatch through the original Developer Diaries and learn more about the Deadlight series!\r\nExplore the gorgeous art of Deadlight in the Deadlight: Directorâ€™s Cut digital art book accessed in-game!\r\n\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: MicrosoftÂ® Windows 7/8/10 â€“ 64bit \r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2,4GHz+ or better \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 512MB video card with Shader model 3.0 support \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nStorage: 5 GB available space \r\nSound Card: DirectX 9 compatible sound card \r\nAdditional Notes: Supports MicrosoftÂ® Xbox 360 controller.[/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee501/Indo_Hd/bcedgfhk.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[i][b][color=orange]Screenshots-:[/color][/b][/i]\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/423950/ss_efbe0f54ec3c919b471d24ad26b7a1381f52907b.600x338.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/423950/ss_51a26fa147c3d9de7854bde7ded21dcf897a938b.600x338.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i1231.photobucket.com/albums/ee501/Indo_Hd/bcedgfhk.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DgpeTWf.gif[/img]\r\n[color=blue][b]Release Notes:- I aM trying to do MY best... so If you want to thank ME..Just Seed MY torrents and do comments on MY uploads...[/b].[/color]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/DgpeTWf.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://yuq.me/users/22/474/5Ue4vgtzn2.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/W3abX.gif[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/8831/q9e4.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[img]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/2315/zfx.gif[/img][/b][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e06101a0fb2b65a20ae2d508f3f5e90c8e68a89","amp;dn":"Deadlight+Director%27s+Cut+%5BCorePack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e06101a0fb2b65a20ae2d508f3f5e90c8e68a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,6,16,26,15,178,182,90,32,174,45,80,143,63,94,144,200,230,138,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
