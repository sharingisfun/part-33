Tags: France, Historical, Paris, Romance, Showbiz. First published in 2004\r\n\r\nisbn:9780730443858 \r\n\r\nAt fourteen, Simone Fleurier is wrenched from her home on a ProvenÃ§al lavender farm and sent to work in Marseilles. Her life there is hard and impoverished, but Simone discovers the music hall and a dream: to one day be a famous dancer and singer.\r\n\r\nBut when war threatens, Simone makes a decision that will lead to great danger â€” yet ultimately prove that love, just like wild lavender, can grow in the least likely of places â€¦\r\n\r\nBelinda Alexandra has created a tale of passion and courage that moves from the backstreets of Marseilles to the grand music theatres of Paris, from the countryside of Provence to decadent pre-war Berlin and jazz-age New York. \r\n\r\nWild Lavender is a feast for the senses that will live on in the imagination long after the book is closed. \r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\n================\r\n\r\nBelinda Alexandra has been published to wide acclaim in Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Holland, Poland, Norway and Spain. She is the daughter of a Russian mother and an Australian father and has been an intrepid traveler since her youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis completes my Belinda Alexandra collection and there are currently no more (as at start of 2016).
