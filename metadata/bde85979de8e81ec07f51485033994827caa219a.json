Sure, 1992's Grave\nDancer's Union was a massive hit, but the follow-up, 1995's Let Your Dim Light\nShine, was perceived as a flop even though it went platinum as the band's snarky\nenergy began to fade, and both 1998's Candy from a Stranger and the 2006\n&quot;comeback&quot; The Silver Lining barely made a ripple among anyone but their most\ncommitted fans, both sounding half-hearted as Dave Pirner's songwriting turned\nunexpectedly silly. In 2012, Soul Asylum are pretty much off everyone's radar\nand they're back to recording for a small indie label, so it makes a certain\nsense that Delayed Reaction is their best album in ages. Anyone hoping this will\nrecall the band's creative zenith of Hang Time or Grave Dancer's Union may be a\nbit let down, but the band has some semblance of their scrappy energy back, and\nsongs like &quot;Gravity,&quot; &quot;The Streets,&quot; &quot;Let's All Kill Each Other,&quot; and &quot;Take\nManhattan&quot; sound energetic, focused, and fun, full of the qualities that made\nSoul Asylum good, rowdy fun before they hit the charts and had to figure out\nwhat to do next. The band isn't quite as good when they slow things down and try\nto convince us of their range, but &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; is a surprisingly\nsuccessful bit of cocktail lounge blues, &quot;Into the Light&quot; is solid pop\nsongcraft, and strip the pretentious string charts from &quot;I Should've Stayed in\nBed&quot; and you'd have a better-than-average moody grunge ballad. And while Dave\nPirner's lyrics are still goofier than they were in his heyday, he sounds\nnoticeably more grounded on The Silver Lining, and the band -- Pirner and Dan\nMurphy on guitars, Tommy Stinson on bass, and Michael Bland on drums -- rocks\nwith solid assurance and a genuine sense of fun. Calling Delayed Reaction the\nbest Soul Asylum album since Let Your Dim Light Shine might sound like damning\nwith faint praise, given how spotty much of their post-Grave Dancer's Union\ncatalog has been, but the truth is, this band hasn't sounded this enjoyable\nsince the mid-'90s, and if it isn't a full-scale return to form, it shows they\naren't a spent force, which is certainly how they sounded on The Silver Lining.\n\n\n____\nseed &amp; enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde85979de8e81ec07f51485033994827caa219a","amp;dn":"Soul_Asylum-Delayed_Reaction-%28Limited_Edition%29-2012-404+%2ANEW%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bde85979de8e81ec07f51485033994827caa219a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,232,89,121,222,142,129,236,7,245,20,133,3,57,148,130,124,170,33,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
