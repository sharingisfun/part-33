Recently, polyhedra and their symmetries have been cast in a new light by combinatorics and group theory. This unique text comprehensively documents the many and varied ways that polyhedra have come to the fore throughout the development of mathematics. The author strikes a balance between covering the historical development of the theory surrounding polyhedra and rigorous treatment of the mathematics involved. Attractively illustrated--including 16 color plates--Polyhedra elucidates ideas that have proven difficult to grasp. Mathematicians, as well as historians of mathematics, will find this book fascinating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2512cca4e9f8cf6198fa5a07a309b428fc856d10","amp;dn":"Polyhedra+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2512cca4e9f8cf6198fa5a07a309b428fc856d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,18,204,164,233,248,207,97,152,250,90,7,163,9,180,40,252,133,109,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
