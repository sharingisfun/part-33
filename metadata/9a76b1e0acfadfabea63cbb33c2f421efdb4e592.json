It showcases their earlier sound, which could be characterized as more aggressive and lo-fi than later directions, and is notable for featuring lead guitarist Jack White (subsequently of The White Stripes and The Upholsterers). By opening for the garage rock band Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians, The Go caught the attention of the independent record label Sub Pop and were eventually signed to the label.\n\n\nMeet Me At The Movies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:23\nSummer Sun Blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:37\nKeep On Trash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:32\nYou Can Get High ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2:10\nIt Might Be Bad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:47\nSuzy Don&amp;#039;t Leave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:23\nGet You Off ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:18\nTired Of The Night ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2:53\nBut You Don&amp;#039;t Know ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2:40\nWhatcha Doin&amp;#039; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 2:44\nOn The Corner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:28\nTime For Moon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3:29\n\nAll Mp3s with 320 Bit rate.
