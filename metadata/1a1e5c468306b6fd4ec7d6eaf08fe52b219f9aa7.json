Alas, the fur flies\n     as Jack Byrnes, Pam's cat-crazy, ex-CIA father, played by Robert De Niro,\n     takes an immediate dislike to her less-than-truthful beau. Greg's quest for\n     approval gets seriously sidetracked as Murphy's Law takes over and a string\n     of mishaps turns him into a master of disaster and total pariah in the eyes\n     of the entire family, all except for his shell-shocked girlfriend, who can't\n     believe she still loves her one-man wrecking crew.\n\n\n\t\n                              Ripper Notes\n                             ---------------\n            This was not a public release.
