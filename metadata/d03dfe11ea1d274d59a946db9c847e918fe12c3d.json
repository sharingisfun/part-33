Since its introduction in 1957, where it was originally intended for service in the Eastern Region, the Class 31 has become increasingly common in both Western and London Midland regions too. Whether it was passenger or freight duties the Class 31 was and is a very versatile locomotive and has survived in service for 53 years. The Class 31 for Train Simulator includes the Class 31 in BR Blue, Railfreight Grey and Civil Engineers Grey and Yellow Liveries, as well as appropriate freight wagons. \n\nIncludes\n- Class 31 in BR Blue, Railfreight Grey and Civil Engineers Grey and Yellow liveries \n- OBA 2-axle hopper wagon \n- HAA 2-axle hopper wagon in new livery \n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nJoin Railworks Central for more addons, support and discussions at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor support and requests email:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e29687838f969280d687948790a2858f838b8ecc818d8f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you want to say thanks, contribute and share an addon with the community then email them to us...
