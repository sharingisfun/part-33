Rodgers (Cengage, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-8400-6846-0\r\n\r\nThis proven, sophomore-level text introduces the basics of coordination, solid-state, and descriptive main-group chemistry in a uniquely accessible manner, featuring a less is more approach. This approach allows you to present concepts and applications that you find particularly important and fascinating. Consistent with the less is more philosophy, the book does not review topics covered in introductory courses, but rather moves directly into topics central to inorganic chemistry. Written in a conversational prose style that is enjoyable and easy to understand, this book presents not only the basic theories and methods of inorganic chemistry (in three self-standing sections), but also a great deal of the history and applications of the discipline. The new edition features new art, more diversified applications, and a new icon system. And to better help students understand how the seemingly disparate topics of the periodical table connect, the book offers revised coverage of the author's Network of Interconnected Ideas on new full color endpapers, as well as on a convenient tear-out card. The author's presentation does not assume prerequisites of organic or physical chemistry.\r\nImportant Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a243d56b240dc0bf44225dbf33a147693150b11a","amp;dn":"Descriptive+Inorganic%2C+Coordination%2C+and+Solid+State+Chemistry+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a243d56b240dc0bf44225dbf33a147693150b11a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,67,213,107,36,13,192,191,68,34,93,191,51,161,71,105,49,80,177,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
