It was also released under the title Breakdance: The Movie in some international locations. The film is a retelling of West Side Story.\n\nKelly, a struggling young jazz dancer (Lucinda Dickey) meets up with two break dancers, Ozone (Adolfo Quinones) and Turbo (Michael Chambers). Overcoming scorn from other dancers disapproving of her hybrid dance style, Kelly soon becomes the sensation of the street crowds.\n\n\nThe film setting was inspired by a German documentary entitled Breakin' and Enterin' set in the Los Angeles multi-racial hip-hop club Radiotron, based out of Macarthur Park in Los Angeles. Many of the artists and dancers including Ice-T (who makes his movie debut as a club MC) and Boogaloo Shrimp went straight from Breakin' and Enterin' to star in Breakin'. Ice-T has stated that he considers the film and his own performance in it to be &quot;whack&quot;.\n\nThe story is a retelling of the 1957 musical West Side Story, which is based in turn on Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare (Kelly's agent James has a West Side Story poster directly behind his desk). Breakin' reverses the genders of the white/Puerto Rican couple. Although Kelly and Ozone are clearly a romantic couple in the sequel, and although they peck briefly in the first film (during the song &quot;99 1/2 Won't Do&quot;), the love scene in which they become a couple has been cut, and now exists only as a glimpse during the end credits.\n\nThe music score featured the hits, &quot;Breakin'... There's No Stoppin Us&quot; by Ollie &amp; Jerry and &quot;Freakshow on the Dance Floor.&quot; Breakin' was followed by a sequel, Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage: English\nEnglish: Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\nNo Subs\nPAL\n\nUntouched","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c82e6ffde7bd0c0ba0691da631fe90890925143b","amp;dn":"Breakin+%5Ba.k.a+Breakdance%5D+%281984%29+DVD-R+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c82e6ffde7bd0c0ba0691da631fe90890925143b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,46,111,253,231,189,12,11,160,105,29,166,49,254,144,137,9,37,20,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
