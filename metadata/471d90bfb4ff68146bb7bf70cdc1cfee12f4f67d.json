Glastonbury Fayre is notable for being photographed by Nicolas Roeg and being one of the first films produced by David Puttnam. The film is a mix of performances from the likes of Arthur Brown and Fairport Convention, as well as scenes of festival-goers enjoying the festival. It does not feature any footage of David Bowie, who played at dawn; but he is on the soundtrack.\n\nAn album of performances from the festival, Revelations: Glastonbury Fayre, was also released in 1972 and has since become a rare collectors' item; however, it features no performances in common with the film. The film received a VHS release during the 1990s but has since been deleted. A DVD of the film was released with the CD edition of the Akarma reissue of the album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:471d90bfb4ff68146bb7bf70cdc1cfee12f4f67d","amp;dn":"Glastonbury+Fayre+%281971+UK+Festival%29.mp4.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"471d90bfb4ff68146bb7bf70cdc1cfee12f4f67d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,29,144,191,180,255,104,20,107,183,191,112,205,193,207,238,18,244,246,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
