In a direct, authoritative challenge to researchers who believe the abduction phenomenon is essentially benevolent and spiritually uplifting, Professor David M. Jacobs proves that there is a far more disturbing and potentially dangerous plan underway, with possible alien domination at its core.\n\nIn this remarkably well-researched and well-written book, Professor Jacobs has added a new complexity and depth to our knowledge of the UFO and abduction phenomena. The secret alien agenda revealed here is ominous, but it must be confronted before it is too late.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca1af3e0a13b6576002f94f302aad299ec6b2f6","amp;dn":"David+Jacobs+-+The+Threat+%281999%29+-+UFO+Abduction+eBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca1af3e0a13b6576002f94f302aad299ec6b2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,161,175,62,10,19,182,87,96,2,249,79,48,42,173,41,158,198,178,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
