It also takes the ability to come up with the big ideas that make a desirable product or service, as well as the skill and perseverance to execute on the thousand small ideas that get your design into the hands of users. It requires expertise in project management, user research, and consensus-building. This comprehensive, full-color volume addresses all of these and more with detailed how-to information, real-life examples, and exercises. Topics include assembling a design team, planning and conducting user research, analyzing your data and turning it into personas, using scenarios to drive requirements definition and design, collaborating in design meetings, evaluating and iterating your design, and documenting finished design in a way that works for engineers and stakeholders alike.\n\nProduct Details\n\n    Paperback: 768 pages\n    Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (March 3, 2009)\n    Language: English\n    ISBN-10: 0470229101\n    ISBN-13: 978-0470229101","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f18214f28bf4d08403298f2564994dc3d302d9a","amp;dn":"Designing+for+the+Digital+Age+-+How+to+Create+Human-Centered+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f18214f28bf4d08403298f2564994dc3d302d9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,24,33,79,40,191,77,8,64,50,152,242,86,73,148,220,61,48,45,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
