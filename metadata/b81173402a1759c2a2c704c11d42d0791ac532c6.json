LINER NOTES ARE NOT AVAILABLE.\n\nEnd of the Century was the fifth studio album by the Ramones, and was originally released on February 4, 1980 on Sire Records. Produced by Phil Spector, it was the first album not to include original drummer Tommy Ramone, who had left the band due to poor record sales. Spector used recording techniques that were completely different from the band's earlier recording, including high-quality overdubbing and echo chambers.\n\nThe album pushed away from the Ramones' punk roots into a more pop-oriented sound, with singles &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?&quot;. It was very successful commercially, becoming the highest charting Ramones album of all time.\n\nChart Performance/History:\n- Peaked at #44 on the US Billboard 200 chart\n- Peaked at #14 on the UK Albums Chart\n\nPersonnel:\nJoey Ramone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals\nJohnny Ramone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lead guitar\nDee Dee Ramone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass,guitar,backing vocals\nMarky Ramone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nSteve Douglas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ saxophone\nBarry Goldberg Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano, organ\nJim Keltner - drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81173402a1759c2a2c704c11d42d0791ac532c6","amp;dn":"End+Of+The+Century+-+Ramones+24bit-192khz+Digital+Download","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81173402a1759c2a2c704c11d42d0791ac532c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,17,115,64,42,23,89,194,162,199,4,193,29,66,208,121,26,197,50,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
