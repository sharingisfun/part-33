There \nhe and his Gestapo underlings conducted their interrogations of \ndetainees. Torture was applied on a regular basis (beatings, \ndrowning, burning, ice baths, forced watching of relatives or \nfriends being tortured, etc.). Many victims report that Barbie \nseemed to get a kick out of inflicting pain on them.\n\nBarbie was known as the &quot;butcher of Lyon&quot;. Hotel Terminus \nbecame a symbol of the last stop before death and for the total \nloss of humanity. The film shows interviews with Barbie's victims, \nclass mates, neighbours, subordinates, sympathisers and business \npartners.\n\nMarcel Ophuls has gone to great lengths to arrive at a very \ndetailed portrayal of Klaus Barbie, contrasting statements \nfrom different interviews, also revealing some aspects of the \noccupation in France during the war and Barbie's life after \nthe war. \n\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0095341/\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_Terminus:_The_Life_and_Times_of_Klaus_Barbie\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b786e903140c4e77eb706f3fd7591dfeb62b0927","amp;dn":"Hotel+Terminus+-+The+Life+and+Times+of+Klaus+Barbie+%281988%2C+Marce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b786e903140c4e77eb706f3fd7591dfeb62b0927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,134,233,3,20,12,78,119,235,112,111,63,215,89,29,254,182,43,9,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
