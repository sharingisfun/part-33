In The \n      Golden Ocean, Snow charts the period from 1690 to 1759   \n      and reveals how England - soon to be Britain - and her  \n      Navy rose from the depths of military and economic     \n      disaster to achieve global supremacy.                   \n                                                               \n      In 1690, France ruled the waves and the Royal Navy was  \n      in tatters. King William III had taken England into a  \n      disastrous war against the most powerful country in     \n      Europe. If England was to survive, it needed a new Navy  \n      one capable of carrying the fight to its enemies        \n      anywhere in the world.                                 \n                                                              \n      To achieve this would require a national effort unlike   \n      anything that had been seen before. King William III's  \n      determination to achieve mastery of the seas unleashed \n      a chain reaction of revolutions in finance, industry    \n      and agriculture which reshaped the landscape and         \n      created the country's first great credit boom. Fifty    \n      years before the Industrial Revolution, the Royal Navy \n      became the engine of global change, propelling Britain  \n      into the modern world.                                   \n                                                              \n      It had the desired effect at sea. By 1759, French      \n      forces around the world were capitulating to Britain's  \n      superior Navy. For the first time in her history,        \n      Britannia really did rule the waves.                    \n                                                                \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88acc14beaa10db13c3bddfc58924b0616ab4eab","amp;dn":"Empire.of.the.Seas.How.the.Navy.Forged.the.Modern.World.S01E02.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88acc14beaa10db13c3bddfc58924b0616ab4eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,172,193,75,234,161,13,177,60,59,221,252,88,146,75,6,22,171,78,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
