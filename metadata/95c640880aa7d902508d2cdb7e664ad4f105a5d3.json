To compensate, points are awarded not only for right answers, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question. \n\n \nConversely, points are deducted from a panellist who gives &quot;answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious,&quot; typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions. \n\n \nPoints are also often deducted if an obvious joke answer is given. These answers are known as forfeits, usually indicated by a loud siren, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being displayed on screen as a form of humiliation. In addition, bonus points are often awarded or deducted for various challenges or incorrect references to a certain thing or place, varying from show to show.\n\n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI&lt;/a&gt;\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n\n\n82 video files\n\n \n\nThe Making Of QI (1x60min)\n \n\nQI - XL's - (50x45min)\n\n \nQI - (31x30min)\n\n\n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name : QI - XL.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 500 MB\nDuration (ms) : 44mn 1s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String : Variable\nTotal bitrate : 1 588 Kbps\nEncoded application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP : 1\nFormat settings - QPel : No\nFormat settings - GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix : Custom\nCodec Id : XVID\nCodec : XviD\nDuration (ms) : 44mn 1s\nBitrate : 1 466 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio : 1.731\nFramerate : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry : YUV\nColos space : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.196\nStream size : 462 MB (92%)\nEncoded library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id : 55\nCodec : MP3\nDuration (ms) : 44mn 1s\nBitrate mode : Variable\nBitrate : 109 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String : Lossy\nStream size : 34.2 MB (7%)\nAlignement : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload : 551 ms\nEncoded library : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c640880aa7d902508d2cdb7e664ad4f105a5d3","amp;dn":"QI+-+Read+Description+-+Feb+2015+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c640880aa7d902508d2cdb7e664ad4f105a5d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,198,64,136,10,167,217,2,80,141,44,219,126,102,74,212,241,5,165,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
