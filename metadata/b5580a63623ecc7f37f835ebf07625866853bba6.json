(1) 1/4&quot; plug has already &quot;harpooned&quot; the &quot;leviathan.&quot;\n\n\n\nLee's first album FIRST COURSE is even better IMO but I haven't it on CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5580a63623ecc7f37f835ebf07625866853bba6","amp;dn":"Lee+Ritenour%2C++1977%2C+CAPTAIN+FINGERS%2C+2nd+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5580a63623ecc7f37f835ebf07625866853bba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,88,10,99,98,62,204,127,55,248,53,235,240,118,37,134,104,83,187,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
