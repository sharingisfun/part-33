Setting out on the trail with a few cavalrymen and Ann Duverall (Arlene Dahl), MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister, they come across an Apache encampment. Ward learns from an Apache woman that Mary has been taken by an Apache called Diablito. Returning to the cavalry fort with Tana, a captive Apache, preparations are made for a full-scale expedition to find Diablito.\n Captain Lorrison (John Hodiak) proposes to Ann. Ann tells Ward that she has accepted his marriage proposal, but Ward persuades her that she is in love with him. The expedition sets off. Tana tries a double-cross and Ward kills him in self-defence. Eventually the trackers come across DiablitoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camp and stampede the horses. A gun battle ensues. A cavalry re-enforcement column arrives and routs the band of Indians. Ward rescues Mary. Lorrison sets off in pursuit of the escaping Apache, but he is ambushed and killed. Mary and Ann are re-united back at the fort.\n       \nSinopse Pt Br:\n\nNeste que ÃƒÂ© o ÃƒÂºltimo filme do diretor Sam Wood, conta uma histÃƒÂ³ria bastante comum de cavalarias do exÃƒÂ©rcito americano contra  os ÃƒÂ­ndios Apaches, mas com boas atuaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes e ÃƒÂ³tima direÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c41b294cdbddcda5128aa1c723a8d244815e74","amp;dn":"Ambush+%5BRobert+Taylor%5D+%281950%29+DVDRip+Oldies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c41b294cdbddcda5128aa1c723a8d244815e74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,196,27,41,76,219,221,205,165,18,138,161,199,35,168,210,68,129,94,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
