The search is not quite as good as Google at figuring\r\nout what you're looking for, but it can be invaluable when you're\r\nout of internet access.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n====\r\nYou could recreate this package by downloading the stackdump viewer and importing the stackexchange data yourself, but it would take a day or\r\nmore of work, lots of RAM (&gt; 10GB) and lots of disk space.\r\nI made this for myself, and thought I'd save you that effort.\r\nStackdump viewer: bitbucket.org/samuel.lai/stackdump\r\nStackexchange data: archive.org/details/stackexchange\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this legal?\r\n==============\r\nYes. The data is released by Stack Exchange Inc. under cc-by-sa 3.0\r\nwhich allows to &quot;remix, transform, and build upon the material&quot;.\r\nThe viewer program is stackdump by Samuel Lai, and is released under\r\nthe MIT License.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I use this? What do I need?\r\n==================================\r\nYou need Python (2.5 or later, but not 3.0), Java (6 or later) and\r\n50 GB of disk space. The package is a working Mercurial repository\r\n(which also provides a way to check that the code hasn't been\r\naltered). You can update the stackdump viewer with a hg\r\npull, as well as add and remove sites with manage.sh if\r\nyou want more, or to free up space. See the stackdump site for instructions how.\r\n\r\nLaunching on Linux:\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nOnce downloaded and the .7z unpacked, run this in the stackdump\r\ndirectory:\r\n    ./start_solr.sh &amp;\r\n    ./start_web.sh\r\nto start up a webserver on localhost:8080. To shut it down,\r\nCtrl+C the two scripts.\r\n\r\nLaunching on Windows:\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nLaunch these two scripts from a shell:\r\n    Start-Solr.ps1\r\n    Start-StackdumpWeb.ps1\r\nto start up a webserver on localhost:8080. To shut them down,\r\nCtrl+C them.\r\nYou might need to first turn on script-running for PowerShell (run\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned in C:WindowsSysWOW64WindowsPowerShellv1.0powershell.exe started\r\nas Administrator). You might then need to edit Start-Solr.ps1 and\r\nreduce -Xmx2048M to -Xmx1048M (maybe only for 32-bit version of\r\nPowerShell? Not sure). After that, starting Start-Solr.ps1 and\r\nStart-StackdumpWeb.ps1 in two different\r\nC:WindowsSysWOW64WindowsPowerShellv1.0powershell.exes should\r\nput up the webserver.\r\n\r\nOther OSes:\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nShould work if you have Python and Java, but I have not tried\r\nmyself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f1b416bd0437032afe7ad7a3a543b2d1b61c371","amp;dn":"Offline+Stack+Overflow+through+stackdump+%282016-06-13%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f1b416bd0437032afe7ad7a3a543b2d1b61c371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,27,65,107,208,67,112,50,175,231,173,122,58,84,59,45,27,97,195,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
