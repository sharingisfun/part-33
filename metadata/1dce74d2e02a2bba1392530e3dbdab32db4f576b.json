Many example problems are solved completely in the body of the text. All chapter-end exercises are sketched in the appendix. The theoretical part of the book is based on the calculus of variations, so the exposition is very transparent and requires little mathematical rigor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dce74d2e02a2bba1392530e3dbdab32db4f576b","amp;dn":"Optimal+Control+with+Engineering+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dce74d2e02a2bba1392530e3dbdab32db4f576b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,206,116,210,224,42,43,186,19,146,83,14,61,189,171,50,219,79,87,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
