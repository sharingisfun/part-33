In any case, there is a vindictive, accusatory tone to songs such as &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot; and &quot;Poles Apart,&quot; and the overarching theme, from the album title to the graphics to the &quot;I-you&quot; pronouns in most of the lyrics, has to do with dichotomies and distinctions, with &quot;I&quot; always having the upper hand. Musically, Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Wright have largely turned the clock back to the pre-Dark Side of the Moon Floyd, with slow tempos, sustained keyboard chords, and guitar solos with a lot of echo.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-division-bell-r198571/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-division-bell-r198571/review&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Division_Bell&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Division_Bell&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEquipment:\n\nLinn LP12\nEkos arm\nAudio Technica AT33PTG MC cartridge\nWhest ps.20 phonostage\nTascam US - 144 soundcard\nSound Studio\n\nFiles are recorded at 96.24 and SRC is performed using iZotope RX\n\nAiff to flac using XLD level 8.\n\nAll records cleaned with Moth RCM.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f520fccbf748791871a856b6013edc6055330bd2","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Division+Bell+%281994%29+%5BVinyl%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f520fccbf748791871a856b6013edc6055330bd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,32,252,203,247,72,121,24,113,168,86,182,1,62,220,96,85,51,11,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
