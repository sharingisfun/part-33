The 2nd part of hr2 was a rebroadcast of the opening part of hr1.....and so on....and so on\n\nThey actually went for 4 hours to try to fix it...and I am still trying to sort it out. \n\nLately, a lot of the stations have been stepping on Rush as he is speaking....cutting away too soon and coming back from a break after he's already started talking. Where I am the stations do it all the time. This station really blew it today. I am putting it up here exactly as it was streamed so you will know it wasn't me that did this. Un-edited...un-broken...just as I got it. The segments are mixed up. So I am trying to organize them but it's taking too long...\nI hope to get this fixed and do another upload later on tonight...late...I suspect there might be a part of the show missing. \n\nIf you don't want to bother with this just wait till later on when I put up one from a different station...or fix this or just download amuck5's recording.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7337730/Rush_Limbaugh_-_Thursday__June_7__2012_MP3_not_CF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7337730/Rush_Limbaugh_-_Thursday__June_7__2012_MP3_not_CF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTIMES to jump to so you can skip the news etc.\n\nthe top of the hour news is about 7 minutes and the mid-show break id about 4 minutes\n\nhr1  pt1 0:00'00   theme\n     pt2 0:29'05\n\nhr2  pt1 0:59'46   theme\n     pt2 01:29'05  theme \n\nhr3  pt1 01:57'04\n     pt2 02:28'53  theme\n\nhr4  pt1 02:56'50\n     pt2 03:28'40  theme\n\ntheme = the segment with the rush theme at the beginning of each hour\n\nthis station is off the list after this!!\n\nthe strange part is this is ''live''..kind of hard to mess it up...but they did","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29c55b4032f89004f1a9b6c5a17d83ed6cd37c09","amp;dn":"The+Rush+Limbaugh+Radio+Show+JUN-07-2012+THURS+KCRS-TX+LIVE+4hrs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29c55b4032f89004f1a9b6c5a17d83ed6cd37c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,197,91,64,50,248,144,4,241,169,182,197,161,125,131,237,108,211,124,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
