Released later that year, the record sketches out a soulful sound similar to Duffy and Corrine Bailey Ray. Ferguson puts her own stamp on the music by co-writing every track, including the lead single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNothingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Real But Love.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Most X Factor finalists load their debut albums with cover songs and schmaltzy ballads; Ferguson, an established songwriter as well as a singer, proves there are other avenues worth exploring.\n\n\n\n    * 1.
