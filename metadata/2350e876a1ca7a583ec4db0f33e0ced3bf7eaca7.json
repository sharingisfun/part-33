I also added an introduction from Mr. Marley.....\n\nAll the CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s used were remastered from the original tapes by Barry Diament for Tuff Gong Records.\n\nSee below for details of how I upsampled.  \n\n\nClose to ten years ago I created this folder of music.  It was a labor of Love.  Bob holds a very special place in my heart for many reasons.  I wanted to share this music with people whose only exposure to Bob was the album &quot;Legend&quot;.   It is some of my favorite songs from every studio album arranged chronologically.  Long before torrent file sharing began I was passing along this disc of music to people to play in their DVD players or computers.  Now, every car stereo, boom box, etc. recognizes CDR's with MP3 files!  How times change....\n\nI would have loved to create this torrent in FLAC but that format wasn't even around when I put this collection together and my intent was to be able to share, on a cd, the music.  What I did do, however, was &quot;re-record&quot; this collection. I am a self-proclaimed &quot;Audiophile&quot; and have been fortunate enough to acquire a pretty decent Hi-Fi.  I used cd's released on the Tuff Gong label (unfortuneately I don't own everything on vinyl!) and used the following equipment to re-record them:\n\nTheta Pearl transport. Kimber Illuminations D60 cable. GW Labs DSP. Kimber Illuminations D60 cable. MSB Gold Link III DAC/P1000 power supply. Cardas Quad Link 5C cables. Linn LK1 preamp. Cardas Quad Link 5C cables. Pioneer PDR 609 CD recorder.\n\nBy re-clocking the digital signal and upsampling the bit rate I think the end result is a more analog sound..... but that's just one man's opinion yah kno?\nSongs 1-58 are 256kps and 59-65 are 320kps.  My God, tracks 60-61 will make your hair tingle....\n\nFor those of you casually interested in Bob I think this is a great way to get exposed to more than what you might have already heard.  For those of us who have made his music part of the fabric of our Lives,  rip this to CD, hit &quot;random play&quot;, and SMILE!\n\nThis is my first torrent, so I welcome constructive feedback.\n\n\n001.
