It was released on November 2, 1999, and over three years after their second studio album, Evil Empire. Between Evil Empire and Los Angeles, the band released a live album, titled Live &amp; Rare. In 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on Rolling Stone magazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Calm Like a BombÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is featured in the credits of The Matrix Reloaded. The videos to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sleep Now in the FireÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“TestifyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were directed by documentarian Michael Moore. Ã¢â‚¬Å“TestifyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is also featured in the video game Rock Band 2. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guerrilla RadioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is also available on Rock Band as DLC.\n\nThe album debuted at #1 on BillboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Top 200 selling 420,000 copies its first week. That week saw a busy CD release schedule. The album denied Mariah CareyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highly anticipated album the chance to open at #1. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guerrilla RadioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was featured in Tony HawkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pro Skater 2, albeit heavily edited on the Nintendo 64 version. Both Time and Rolling Stone named it the Best Album of 1999. It was listed as #53 in SPIN MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005.\n\nThe album cover art was an original artwork by the LA Street Phantom aka Joey Krebs aka Joel Jaramillo, a well-known Los Angeles artist who has exhibited at numerous galleries in Los Angeles, New York City and throughout the United States.
