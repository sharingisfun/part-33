It was previously posted using a .cdr file extension that was only used on cdrwin 5 and virtually impossible to find. I&amp;#039;ve seperated the flles and posted them in .wav format and you can use Nero (or similar) to burn to audio cd. \n\nNote.. \n\nThis is in dts format and playable ONLY on dts capable software or equipment. Playing on a normaal cd player or cd software will result in white noise and may damage speakers. \n\nI don&amp;#039;t know if this is true 5.1 or and upmix but the sound is great and that&amp;#039;s why I&amp;#039;m posting for all surround fan&amp;#039;s to enjoy. \n\nseed seed seed\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdbf45a4c038b912a77151e00f67913dee671112","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+and+BB+King+Riding+With+the+King+DTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdbf45a4c038b912a77151e00f67913dee671112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,191,69,164,192,56,185,18,167,113,81,224,15,103,145,61,238,103,17,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
