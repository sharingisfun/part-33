Some of the hunting and trapping techniques may be considered illegal today and one can make more money off of trapping today but then again in 1881 there were no income taxes and the dollar was still on the gold standard $10.00 for an otter pelt weren't bad but still if fur companies paid for furs back then what they pay today a lot of them old time trappers would have been living in the lap of luxery. This book is an excellent look back into a era where things were a little less complicated.\nSorry if you thought this book was about men mincing in the trees do Julian clarey impressions,lol","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3894d67bc6e6eb5ab88c62e83e949a49410890e8","amp;dn":"Camp+Life+in+the+Woods+and+the+Tricks+of+Trapping+EBOOK-SHAREGO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3894d67bc6e6eb5ab88c62e83e949a49410890e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,148,214,123,198,230,235,90,184,140,98,232,62,148,154,73,65,8,144,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
