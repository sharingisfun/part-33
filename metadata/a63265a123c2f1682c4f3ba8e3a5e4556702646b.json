Do I belong to a new race on Earth, bred by men from outer space in embraces with Earth women? Are my children offspring of the first interplanetary race? Has the melting-pot of interplanetary society already been created on our planet, as the melting-pot of all Earth nations was established in the USA 190 years ago? \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOr does this thought relate to things to come in the future? I request my right and privilege to have such thoughts and ask such questions without being threatened to be jailed by any administrative agency of society... In the face of a rigid, doctrinaire, self-appointed, ready to-kill hierarchy of scientific censorship it appears foolish to publish such thoughts. Anyone malignant enough could do anything with them. Still the right to be wrong has to be maintained. We should not fear to enter a forest because there are wildcats around in the trees. We should not yield our right to well-controlled speculation. It is certain questions entailed in such speculation which the administrators of established knowledge fear... But in entering the cosmic age we should certainly insist on the right to ask new, even silly questions without being molested.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nThe scientist, Wilhelm Reich, writing in his book, Contact With Space. Reich died in a United States jail on November 3rd 1957. \n \nBack to Contents\n \n \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDays of decision\n\nWe are on the cusp of an incredible global change. A crossroads where we make decisions which will influence life on Earth well into the future of what we call time. We can fling open the doors of the mental and emotional prisons which have confined the human race for thousands of years. Or we can allow the agents of that control to complete their agenda for the mental, emotional, spiritual and physical enslavement of every man, woman and child on the planet with a world government, army, central bank and currency, underpinned by a micro-chipped population. \n\nI know that sounds fantastic, but if the human race lifted its eyes from the latest soap opera or game show for long enough to engage its brain, it would see that these events are not just going to happen - they are happening. The momentum for the centralized control of global politics, business, banking, military and media is gathering pace by the hour. The micro-chipping of people is already being suggested and, in many cases, underway. \n \nWhenever a hidden agenda is about to be implemented there is always the period when the hidden has to break the surface for the final push into physical reality. This is what we are seeing now in the explosion of mergers between global banking and business empires, and the speed at which political and economic control is being centralized through the European Union, the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, and the stream of other globalizing bodies like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the G-7/G-8 summits. \n \nBehind this constant and coordinated centralization is a tribe of interbreeding bloodlines which can be traced to the ancient Middle and Near East. They emerged from there to become the royalty, aristocracy and priesthood of Europe before expanding their power across the world, largely through the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GreatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ British Empire. This allowed the tribe to export its bloodlines to all the countries the British and European powers occupied, including the United States where they continue to run the show to this day. \n \nThere have been just over 40 Presidents of the United States and 33 of them have been genetically related to two people, EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s King Alfred the Great and Charlemagne, the famous monarch in 9th century France. Throughout this whole period the agenda of this bloodline has been gradually implemented until we have reached the point today where centralized global control is possible. \n\nIf you want to know what life will be like unless we wake up fast, take a look at Nazi Germany. That is the world that awaits the global population as the plan I call the Brotherhood Agenda unfolds across the year 2000 and into the first 12 years of the new century. 2012 particularly, appears to be a crucial year for reasons we shall discuss. People have no idea of the abyss we are staring into or the nature of the world we are leaving for our children to endure and most people donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to care. They would much rather ignore the obvious and go into denial of a truth thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s splatting them between the eyes. I feel like the cow who runs into the field screaming: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey, you know that truck that takes some of our friends away every month? Well they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take them to another field like we thought. They shoot them in the head, bleed them dry, cut them up, and put the pieces into packets. Then those humans buy them and eat them!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nImagine what the reaction of the rest of the herd would be: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re crazy man. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d never do that. Anyway, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got shares in that trucking company and I get a good return. Shut up, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re making waves.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nThe Agenda I am exposing has been unfolding over thousands of years to its current point close to completion, because humanity has given away its mind and its responsibility. Humanity would rather do what it thinks is right for itself in the moment than consider the wider consequences of its behavior for human existence. Ignorance is bliss, we say, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true - but only for a while. It may be bliss not to know a tornado is coming because you have no need to worry or take action. But while your head is in the sand your bum is in the air, the tornado is still coming. \n\nIf you looked up and faced it, disaster could be avoided, but ignorance and denial always ensure that you will get the full force and the most extreme consequences, because it strikes when least expected and you are least prepared. Like I say, ignorance is bliss - but only for so long. We create our own reality by our thoughts and actions. For every action or non-action there is a consequence. When we give our minds and our responsibility away, we give our lives away. If enough of us do it, we give the world away and that is precisely what we have been doing throughout known human history. This is why the few have always controlled the masses. \n \nThe only difference today is that the few are now manipulating the entire planet because of the globalization of business, banking and communications. The foundation of that control has always been the same: keep the people in ignorance, fear and at war with themselves. Divide, rule and conquer while keeping the most important knowledge to yourself (see Figure 1). And as we shall see in this book, those who have used these methods to control humanity for thousands of years are members of the same force, the same interbreeding tribe, following a long term Agenda which is now reaching a major point on its journey. The global fascist state is upon us. \n\nAnd yet, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be like this. The real power is with the many, not the few. \n\n \nIndeed infinite power is within every individual. The reason we are so controlled is not that we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the power to decide our own destiny, it is that we give that power away every minute of our lives. When something happens that we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like, we look for someone else to blame. When there is a problem in the world, we say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat are they going to do about itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. At which point they, who have secretly created the problem in the first place, respond to this demand by introducing a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“solutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - more centralization of power and erosion of freedom. \n \nIf you want to give more powers to the police, security agencies and military, and you want the public to demand you do it, then ensure there is more crime, violence and terrorism, and then itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a cinch to achieve your aims. Once the people are in fear of being burgled, mugged or bombed, they will demand that you take their freedom away to protect them from what they have been manipulated to fear. The Oklahoma bombing is a classic of this kind, as I detail in .. And The Truth Shall Set You Free. I call this technique problem-reaction-solution. Create the problem, encourage the reaction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsomething must be doneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and then offer the solution. It is summed up by the Freemason motto ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ordo Ab ChaoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - order out of chaos. Create the chaos and then offer the way to restore order. Your order. \n\nThe masses are herded and directed by many and various forms of emotional and mental control. It is the only way it could be done. The few canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t control billions of people physically, just as farm animals cannot be controlled physically unless a large number of people are involved. Two pigs escaped from a slaughterhouse in England and eluded capture for so long, despite the efforts of many people to catch them, that they became national celebrities. \n \nPhysical control of the global population cannot work. But it is not necessary when you can manipulate the way people think and feel to the point where they ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“decideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to do what you want them to do anyway and demand that you introduce laws that you want to introduce. It is an old, old adage that if you want someone to do something, get them to believe it is their idea.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Humanity is mind controlled and only slightly more conscious than your average zombie. Far fetched? No, no. \n \nI define mind control as the manipulation of someoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind so that they think, and therefore act, the way you want them to. Under this definition, the question is not how many people are mind controlled, but how few are not. \n \nEveryone is to a larger or lesser extent. When you are persuaded by advertising or hype to buy something you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really need or want, you are being mind controlled. When you read or hear a slanted news story and allow it to affect your perception of a person or event, you are being mind controlled. Look at the training for the armed forces. It is pure mind control. From day one you are told to take orders without question and if some berk in a peaked cap tells you to shoot people you have never met and know nothing about, you must shoot without question. \n \nThis is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes sir!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mentality and it pervades the non-military world, also. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWell, I know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not right, but the boss told me to do it and I had no choice.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ No choice? We never have no choice. We have choices we would like to make and choices we would rather less like to make. But we never have no choice. To say so is another cop out. \n\nThe list of mind manipulating techniques is endless. They want your mind because when they have that, they have you. The answer lies in taking our minds back, thinking for ourselves and allowing others to do the same without fear of ridicule or condemnation for the crime of being different. If we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do that, the Agenda I am going to outline will be implemented. But if we do regain control of our minds and achieve mental sovereignty, the Agenda cannot happen because the foundation of its existence will have been taken away. \n \nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve talked and researched in more than 20 countries and I see the same process in every one of them. Identical policies and structures are introduced in line with a Global Agenda, yet at the same time there is quite obviously a global awakening as more and more people hear the spiritual alarm clock and emerge from their mental and emotional slumbers, the terrestrial trance. Which force will prevail in these Millennium years to 2012? That is up to us. We create our own reality by our thoughts and actions. If we change our thoughts and actions we will change the world. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that simple. \n\nIn this book I am going to chart the history of the interbreeding tribe of bloodlines which control the world today and reveal the true nature of the Global Agenda. And I would emphasize that I am exposing an Agenda, not a conspiracy as such. The conspiracy comes in manipulating people and events to ensure the Agenda is introduced. \n \nThese conspiracies take three main forms: \n1.conspiring to remove people and organizations that are a threat to the Agenda (the assassination of Diana, Princess of Wales)\n2.conspiring to put people into positions of power who will make the Agenda happen (George Bush, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, et al)\n3.conspiring to create events which will make the public demand the Agenda is introduced through problem-reaction-solution (wars, terrorist bombs, economic collapses)\nIn this way all these apparently unconnected events and manipulations become aspects of the same conspiracy to introduce the same Agenda. In the months and years that follow, every time you pick up a paper, turn on the television or hear a speech from a political or business leader, you are going to see the information outlined here coming to pass. You already can if you understand the scam. Look at my previous books like ...And The Truth Shall Set You Free, I Am Me I Am Free, The RobotsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Rebellion, the video Turning Of The Tide, and the work of other researchers over decades and you will see that what was predicted is happening. \n \nThis is not prophecy, it is merely the prior knowledge of the Agenda. So will the global fascist state be realized in the next few years? That question can only be answered by another: are we going to become people or continue as sheeple? \n\nThe Agenda depends on the latter. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a63265a123c2f1682c4f3ba8e3a5e4556702646b","amp;dn":"The+Biggest+Secret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a63265a123c2f1682c4f3ba8e3a5e4556702646b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,50,101,161,35,194,241,104,44,79,59,168,227,165,228,85,103,2,100,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
