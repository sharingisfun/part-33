Manthorne focuses on 19th-century American artists (including major figures like Church and Whistler) who went to Latin America and convincingly argues that their experiences helped determine North American perceptions of the land, history, and people of those southern regions. Well documented and illustrated; especially recommended for libraries with an emphasis on American civilization or Latin American studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0eb3cd7d77a190c82497d92e88dc5acc251105a","amp;dn":"Tropical+Renaissance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0eb3cd7d77a190c82497d92e88dc5acc251105a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,235,60,215,215,122,25,12,130,73,125,146,232,141,197,172,194,81,16,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
