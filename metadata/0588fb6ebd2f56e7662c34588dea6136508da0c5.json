I brought this book to you to save your 27$ and too see how \n\nsimple and worthless is this trick. Enjoy!\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n&quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been studying and performing mentalism for over 10 years and from the very beginning I was looking for a fool-proof \n\nway to pick up on what a spectator is thinking or what they are about to choose. I found that even only a fifty-fifty \n\nchoice was a remarkably difficult thing to predict consistently. Over the years I bought and developed a whole host of \n\ndifferent methods that ranged from using psychology or reading body language right through to expensive covert electronics. \n\nThey all had their problems:\n\nSome of them were unreliable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they let me increase my chances of being correct but there was still a risk that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be \n\nwrong. Needless to say this can be embarrassing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but if you are betting on the fact you are correct it can also be \n\nexpensive!\nSome of them were too limited Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they might have let me correctly predict whether a coin was being held in someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“LeftÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nor Ã¢â‚¬Å“RightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but not whether they were thinking of something Ã¢â‚¬Å“HotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“ColdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nOthers were too indirect Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they required the spectator writing something down, suspicious moves, or using some prop that \n\nreally distracted from direct mindreading that I wanted to achieve.\nI was just about ready to give up on the idea of a direct, repeatable, 100% accurate mind reading effect when I stumbled \n\nacross this new method. I was so excited by its simplicity and reliability that the effect went straight in to my act and \n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been refining and developing it ever since and have now packaged it into book titled the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes/No TrickÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0588fb6ebd2f56e7662c34588dea6136508da0c5","amp;dn":"Yes%2FNo+Trick+E-book+-+From+http%3A%2F%2Fyesnotrick.com%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0588fb6ebd2f56e7662c34588dea6136508da0c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,136,251,110,189,47,86,231,102,44,52,88,141,234,97,54,80,141,160,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
