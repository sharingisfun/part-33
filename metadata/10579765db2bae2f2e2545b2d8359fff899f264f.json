Used to mostly boring, buttoned-up corporate roles, she could bring her real self out to play and instead of hiding her tats and piercings, they were fully out on display. That, of course, made her instantly recognisable to her sexy dance partner from the club last week when he walks in the door. But Sienna's very good at what she doesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and it was no coincidence that she had met him then and runs into him now.\n\nThe attraction between them is still off the charts, but Sienna has a job to do and part of that is treating as a suspect everyone associated with the business she's infiltrating. One fact she knows for sureÃ¢â‚¬â€Greg Mazzeo is keeping a secret too, and she needs to find out what it is as soon as possible.
