Ancient cave drawings of strange creatures, remains of landing strips in Peru, and Indian texts that describe the &quot;flying machines of the gods&quot; were just a few of the odd archaeological artefacts cited by von Daniken as proof that ancient astronauts were well known to our ancestors. Produced with the exclusive cooperation of von Daniken himself, Ancient Aliens launches all-new expeditions to seek out and evaluate this evidence, with a concentration on the latest discoveries of the last 30 years, including unusual DNA findings on man's evolution and newly decoded artefacts from Egypt to Syria to South America. It is a balanced investigation into a theory some believe cannot be true, but many agree cannot be ignored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd1755bcf98d22dcd27c4d760228bd38e2670ddb","amp;dn":"History+Channel+Ancient+Aliens+S01E04+Closer+Encounters+720p+HDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd1755bcf98d22dcd27c4d760228bd38e2670ddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,23,85,188,249,141,34,220,210,124,77,118,2,40,189,56,226,103,13,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
