With one segment of the narrative focused on the town's founders    :\n : circa 1890 and another showing the lives of their descendants in 2006, the :\n : novel develops as a kind of conversation between two epochs, one rushing   :\n : blindly toward the future and the other struggling to undo the damage of   :\n : the past.                                                                  :\n :                                                                            :\n : An exposition on the effects of time, on how something said or done in one :\n : generation keeps echoing through all the years that follow, and how        :\n : mistakes keep happening and people keep on trying to be strong and brave   :\n : and, most important, just and right, West of Here harks back to the work of:\n : such masters of Americana as Bret Harte, Edna Ferber, and Larry McMurtry,  :\n : writers whose fiction turned history into myth and myth into a nation's    :\n : shared experience.
