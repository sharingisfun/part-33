Talese (January 20, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 038550800X\nISBN-13: 978-0385508001\n\nGothic, mysterious, theatrical, fatally flawed, and dazzling, the life of Edgar Allan Poe, one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest and most versatile writers, is the ideal subject for Peter Ackroyd. Poe wrote lyrical poetry and macabre psychological melodramas; invented the first fictional detective; and produced pioneering works of science fiction and fantasy. His innovative style, images, and themes had a tremendous impact on European romanticism, symbolism, and surrealism, and continue to influence writers today.\nIn this essential addition to his canon of acclaimed biographies, Peter Ackroyd explores PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s literary accomplishments and legacy against the background of his erratic, dramatic, and sometimes sordid life. Ackroyd chronicles PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult childhood, his bumpy academic and military careers, and his complex relationships with women, including his marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin. He describes PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much-written-about problems with gambling and alcohol with sympathy and insight, showing their connections to PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood and the trials, as well as the triumphs, of his adult life. AckroydÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughtful, perceptive examinations of some of PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous works shed new light on these classics and on the troubled and brilliant genius who created them.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nNoted author Ackroyd (The Thames) adds to his one-man Brief Lives series this exploration of the shortÃ¢â‚¬â€and predominantly miserableÃ¢â‚¬â€life of Edgar Allan Poe. Bringing his novelist's skills to bear, Ackroyd opens with Poe's mysterious death in 1849: Like his narratives and his fables, Poe's own story ends abruptly and inconclusively.... Born in Boston in 1809 to traveling actors and orphaned in 1811, Poe was adopted by Richmond, Va., merchant John Allan. Their relationship soured, and Poe left for a rocky academic career at the University of Virginia and a stint at West Point, and in 1836 he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia. Despite critical acclaim for his workÃ¢â‚¬â€from 1839's The Fall of the House of Usher to his famous 1845 poem, The RavenÃ¢â‚¬â€Poe constantly struggled with alcoholism and poverty, alienating almost everyone he met. At age 40, Poe was discovered dying in a Baltimore tavern; his whereabouts for the previous week remain unknown. But Ackroyd never demonizes the melancholic man who influenced writers as diverse as Jules Verne and James Joyce, and his readable account should appeal to Poe devotees and newcomers alike. Illus.

As Ackroyd immediately remarks, Poe is the quintessential poete maudit, or accursed artist, greatly talented but thwarted by circumstances at every turn. Portraying Poe as permanently affected by his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ignominious, youthful death, Ackroyd projects from PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother fixation his affectional preferences for ill young women such as his wife (and cousin) Virginia Clemm or, when such were unavailable, motherly (but not matronly) aesthetes; meanwhile, dying and dead young beauties haunt his stories and poems. Raised in England and Virginia as something of a charity case, Poe was acutely aware of his gifts, which included unforgettable looks, and, morbidly defensive of them, made for an erratic character, alternately efficient and perspicacious, charming and brilliant in conversation, and vindictive and bizarre in behaviorÃ¢â‚¬â€the last especially when he was drunk, as he lamentably often was; in short, definitely attractive-repulsive and ingratiating-infuriating. Though a bit breezy, this is a fine place to begin celebrating the 2009 Poe bicentennial. --Ray Olson\n\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ackroyd is like a literary spiritualist who summons up the voices of the dead and encourages them to possess his writingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.
