It includes proofs of all theorems and contains many examples with solutions.\n It is written for researchers, engineers and advanced students who wish to increase their familiarity with different topics of modern and classical mathematics related to system and automatic control theories. It also has applications to game theory, machine learning and intelligent systems.\n\n * Provides comprehensive theory of matrices, real, complex and functional analysis\n * Provides practical examples of modern optimization methods that can be effectively used in variety of real-world applications\n * Contains worked proofs of all theorems and propositions presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c31fbfc6617843134007163636af8564f4d300","amp;dn":"Advanced+Mathematical+Tools+for+Control+Engineers%3A+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c31fbfc6617843134007163636af8564f4d300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,195,31,191,198,97,120,67,19,64,7,22,54,54,175,133,100,244,211,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
