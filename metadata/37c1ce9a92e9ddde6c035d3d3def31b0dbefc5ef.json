The 24th Wacken Open Air included over 120 bands on seven stages, 75.000 fans and most of all sun, sun and more sun. Metalheads from all over the world celebrated the most legendary party of them all and turned the little village of Wacken in Northern Germany into the place to be for any self-respecting Metalhead.\n\nThe 24th Wacken Open Air once more proved to be unique, with a special vibe which has to be experienced to understand. Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Live at Wacken 2013Ã¢â‚¬Å“, brings this atmosphere right home on DVD, Bu and CD! The hits, the legends, the fans - and many, many memorable shows.\n\nThe 3-DVD-set and also the 3-Bluray-set offer plenty of music with 43 bands and 106 songs. The audio version on 2 CDs features 32 highlights. Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Live at Wacken 2013Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is available on July 28th (UK) and 28th (US), on DVD, CD, BluRay Amaray and as digital download.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs even better, there are some gems hidden in some of these: One Golden Ticket for a Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Lifetime Membership for the W:O:AÃ¢â‚¬Å“ giving the lucky winner the opportunity to enjoy the festival every year till eternity without buying a ticket. Also randomly included are ten Silver VIP Tickets that include a tour through the Artist Village on the festival grounds. A dream come true for any Metalhead...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å¾Live at Wacken 2013Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even serves a good cause that keeps heavy music alive: All bands and labels have donated their royalties to the Wacken Foundation, a non-profit organisation in support of the Hard Rock and Heavy Metal scene (www.wacken-foundation.com). UDR Records will also be making a donation of 1 Euro for each and every DVD &amp; CD sold, with everyone involved, from manufacturing to marketing, supporting the Foundation.\n\nYou will see Rock icon Alice Cooper, who knows better than most how to put on a show. His Wacken appearance is no exception, with three guitarists, lots of action and hits like Ã¢â‚¬ËœBillion Dollar BabiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœHey StoopidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Nightwish with new singer Floor Jansen receives ecstatic reactions, Metal Queen Doro celebrates her 30th anniversary of being on stage, and Sabaton sings with a huge audience choir in the midday sun. Mr. RockÃ¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬ËœRoll himself, Lemmy Kilmister, hits the stage, ignoring recent health issues that caused several show postponements. In blistering heat, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead delivered a shortened set, blasting through Ã¢â‚¬ËœDamage CaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMetropolisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœOver The TopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ like only they can. Deep Purple have been equally groundbreaking as the genreÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs forefathers and played Wacken for the first time. The fans were not disappointed, as shown during their classic Ã¢â‚¬ËœLazyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nAnd the list goes on: the Thrash Metal wake-up call that Annihilator opens the festival with, the wild moshpits during AnthraxÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ classic-filled set, the big epicness of Lingua Mortis Orchestra feat. Rage and surprises like Ugly Kid Joe, who invited MotÃƒÂ¶rhead guitarist Phil Campbell for their rowdy rendition of Ã¢â‚¬ËœAce Of SpadesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nTracklist:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ BD#1\n01.
