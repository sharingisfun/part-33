Featuring a chosen party of five, you role-play Necholai, a minor god of a celestial body who descends to the Staglands for a moonlit festival only to find the way home blocked and immortality slipping away. Seeking answers and aid, you take on a mortal body and the guise of a traveling Spicer. This isn't a story of good and evil, saving the world or being a hero, it's about intrigue and your adventure of survival in a harsh land.\nWhile the game rolls the dice for you, you'll traverse the Staglands on a path narrated by your own wits and choices. A tabletop inspired experience with adventure-game like navigation, Serpent in the Staglands offers no auto-populating map markers, checklist quest grinding and rigid story exposition.\nExamine hand-drawn maps in your inventory for secret locations, diagrams of foreign languages, note encounters of interest in your in-game journal and figure out on your own how best to smuggle Spices. Roleplay, investigate, and pray to the RNG god when combat begins.\nParty-based, real time with pause combat focused on macro tactical decisions and creative party skill combinations\nClassless role-playing system: create builds via any combination of magic, combat and aptitude skills available to create or find up to 5 unique characters\nNon-linear storyline to uncover and explore through dialogue, clue and puzzles\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8\nProcessor: 2.4 GHz Pentium IV or equivalent AMD Athlon processor\nMemory: 3 GB RAM\nGraphics: 512 MB+\nDirectX: Version 9.0\nHard Drive: 3 GB available space\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b076d121b7c1f2eaf7b6901abb5fec1d602a192","amp;dn":"Serpent+in+the+Staglands+%282.8.0.9%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b076d121b7c1f2eaf7b6901abb5fec1d602a192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,7,109,18,27,124,31,46,175,123,105,1,171,181,254,193,214,2,161,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
