ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s based on the principle that to write good, high-performance, robust applications you need to understand whats going on deep under the hood. If you are already experienced with writing managed applications and want to learn more about how to get the best from the  language at an advanced level, then this is the book for you.\n\nExpert C# 5.0 discusses the familiar C# language in forensic detail. Examining familiar elements closely to reveal how they really work. Key language features that you are already familiar with, such as Enums, Strings and Collections, are teased apart and examined under the twin microscopes of MSIL (Intermediate Language)  and the Windbg debugger to see whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really going on behind the scenes as your code is compiled and passed to the CLR.\n\nThis unparalleled depth of explanation will help you to become a true master of the C# language and architect better crafted applications that work in the most efficient and reliable way possible. It will also give you the insight you need to rapidly identify and fix the stubborn coding faults that others may be unable to diagnose.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Learn the detailed workings behind common language elements such as Enum, readonly, Anonymous and Func.\n- Understand how to work with Strings and StringBuilder in the most effective way.\n- Master Exception management far beyond the basics.\n- See how components such as LINQ and Async interact with the C# language beneath the surface.\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for experienced C# developers who are comfortable working with the language. You should be happy creating non-trivial code samples and ready to delve into the detail of the languageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workings in order to truly master the concepts.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 612 pages\nPublisher: Apress (December 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1430248602\nISBN-13: 978-1430248606","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee1131de0a5699c8baabd7560eecfb26abd54ed4","amp;dn":"Expert+C%23+5.0+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee1131de0a5699c8baabd7560eecfb26abd54ed4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,17,49,222,10,86,153,200,186,171,215,86,14,236,251,38,171,213,78,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
