Story of a Soul: A Study Edition, translated by John Clarke, with study materials by Marc Foley (ICS, 2005). This is the best translation of Therese's book, and this edition includes commentary and other helps to reading and understanding it.\n\n2. Storm of Glory: St. Therese of Lisieux, by John Beevers (Sheed and Ward, 1950). A straightforward older biography, well-written, good for those new to St. Therese, but not the most up-to-date.\n\n3. The Story of a Life: St. Therese of Lisieux, by Guy Gaucher (HarperCollins, 1987). Probably the best general biography.\n\n4. Therese of Lisieux: God's Gentle Warrior, by Thomas R. Nevin (Oxford Univ. Press, 2006). In-depth biography and analysis by an author determined to avoid hagiography.\n\n5. The Spiritual Genius of St. Therese of Lisieux, by Jean Guitton (Burnes and Oates, 2001). Analysis of St. Therese by an important French thinker.\n\n6. The Little Way: The Spirituality of ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se of Lisieux, by Bernard Bro (DLT, 1997). A very good attempt to show St. Therese's contemporary relevance.\n\n7. Smiles of God: The Flowers of Saint Therese of Lisieux, by Felicity Leng (Burnes and Oates, 2003). An analysis of the theme and symbolism of &quot;flowers&quot; in St. Therese, by the translator of #6.\n\n\nNumbers 1-3 and 6 are new scans. Numbers 4, 6 and 7 appear to have a retail source (though 6 and 7 are high-quality scans), but I've processed all of them in various ways to improve them, reduce the file size, make them more readable or usable, etc.\n\nOne of these books -- I forget which one -- has a small error in that it opens initially to the page thumbnails in the side panel instead of the contents.
