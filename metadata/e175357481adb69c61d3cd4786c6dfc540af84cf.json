In fact, regardless of country or economic conditions, entrepreneurial enterprises are on the rise. High-tech start-ups, where innovation, dedication, collaboration, and pure genius align into a successful enterprise, will likely see good timesâ€”if they start up right. However, many young researchers hesitate to set up their own company. Written by an electrical engineer with more than nineteen years of successful business experience, Entrepreneurship for Engineers covers every aspect you must master to become a savvy entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nThe author provides coverage of the fundamentals of global economies, accounting, finance, and quantitative business analysis, because ordinary engineers usually lack these necessary survival skills. Outlining a systematic preparation process that will build a great reputation in the commercial marketplace, the author answers:\r\n\r\nHow to start up a company\r\nHow to create product lines\r\nHow to collect venture capital\r\nHow to write successful R&amp;D proposals\r\nHow to apply forward thinking\r\nHow to keep cash flowing in a small firm\r\n\r\nTypical MBA courses include the following curricula: economics, accounting, finance/investment, marketing, and human resources, with courses like Managerial Communications and Quantitative Business Analysis (Applied Mathematics), and finally Strategic Management and Business Ethics. Engineering curricula seldom includes any of this. Supplying almost all the knowledge necessary for operating a corporation, above and beyond what you may find in an MBA program, this book uses an approach to business that is just as disciplined and rigorous as any approach to engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e175357481adb69c61d3cd4786c6dfc540af84cf","amp;dn":"Entrepreneurship+for+Engineers+-+Kenji+Uchino","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e175357481adb69c61d3cd4786c6dfc540af84cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,117,53,116,129,173,182,156,97,211,205,71,134,198,223,197,64,175,132,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
