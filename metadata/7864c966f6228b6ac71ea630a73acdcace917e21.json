His attache case has been exchanged by mistake with a travelling companion. He is not sure who it is, but wishes to return the attache case to its rightful owner. Feluda learns that Dinanath's box contains a manuscript of a travelogue by a famous traveller but no one seems to realise its value. Then why is Feluda's life in danger? How Feluda unravels both mysteries is the story of Baksho Rahossyo...\n\nBosepukure Khunkharapi: \n\n\tThe Acharyas of Bosepukur are an old aristrocatic family, but against their family traditions, their youngest son Indranarayan is a playwright for the Jatra (Folk Theatre) company Bharat Opera. Indranarayan is attacked one day and comes to Feluda. The next evening he is murdered. Why was Indranarayan murdered? Who was the murderer? was it only for his plays or has it something to do with the valuable curios that belong to the Bose family? Feluda investigates...\n\nSheyal-Debota Rahossyo:\n\n\tOne of the early Feluda stories which is set before Jatayu became part of the team. Feluda is still an amateur sleuth, who is called by one Nilmoni Sanyal a collector of objects d'Art. He has been getting some anonymous letters written in hieroglyphics. Sanyal has also recently bought a small but valuable statue of Anubis, the jackal headed god of the dead of ancient Egypt. The next day Sanyal is attacked in his home and the statue stolen. Feluda gets threats too. Then some Egyptian objects were stolen from another collector, Pratul Gupta. It appears that the thief is a young boy, but no one can locate him, until Feluda solves the mystery and discovers the surprising identity of the real thief...\n\n\nComments:\n---------\n\nHave you wondered why this series is called Feluda 30? The first Feluda story (Feluda'r Goendagiri) appeared in in the December 1965-February 1966 edition of the childrens magazine Sandesh and he has been the most popular detective ever since. This series made in 1996 commemorates the 30th anniversary of the First appearance of Feluda.\n\nAlthough not part of the Angel Video DVD Release, Baksho Rahossyo was part of the original Television Series (Feluda 30, 1996, aired on DD Bangla) and so is included in this collection.\n\n\n\nUploader's Notes:\n-----------------\n\nThe Menus:\n\nFirst about the menu. It is in two parts. The Wecome menu consists of the welcome scene from some of the Feluda 30 films and the second part is from Royal Bengal Rahossyo. Both these video clips have been seamlessly added to each other and some animation (like the gun shooting the film posters) added as are the Bengali letters for 30. The music is from Feluda 30.\n\nThe main menu background has the ribbons first seen in Satyajit Ray Presents. To this we have added the images of \n\nFeluda and Topshe. The images of the two actors who played Jatayu (Robi Ghosh &amp; Anup Kumar) altrnate, keeping the \n\nthreesome intact at all times. Some additional animation helps to spice up the menu. The music is the Feluda theme from Sonar Kella.\n\nThe two menus are in 1080p (1920x1080) size. Both are animated.\n\nHow To Play:\n\nOffline: This is a AVCHD rip with the three parts organised and a menu added in a Blu-Ray format. To play from a DVD disc, use any burning software such as ImgBurn to write the entire AVCHD folder to a 8.5 GB DVD disc. You can then play it on any player that is AVCHD compatible (all blu-ray players are). It works on my Phlips player.\n\nOn your PC: If you don't have a Blu-Ray player, you can watch the movie on your PC.  It will not fully play on VLC or any ordinary player. To play this please download a Blu-Ray player software. I recommend Nero Blu-Ray player which plays it perfectly. Just drag and drop the AVCHD folder into Nero Blu-Ray Player.\n\nIf you insist on using your existing software, you can do it still. Just open the folders until you reach the sub-folder called 'STREAM'. There you will find five files. 00000.MTS is GGBB; 00001.MTS is HRD and 00003.MTS is GBFE; 01200.MTS is the Welcome Menu and 01201.MTS is the main Menu. Each will individually play in VLC or MPC etc. But the menus will not respond to mouse clicks on its buttons.\n\n\n\nThe remaining Films\n--------------------\n\nThe three remaining films, namely 'Gosaipir Sorgorom', 'Joto Kando Kathmandute' and ''Ekei Bole Shooting' are being uploaded as a second DVD9 disc. We will also upload all six films in AVC/X264/MKV format, but the MKV uploads will not have the Menu(s) described above.\n\n\nIMDB Link:\n----------\nNot available...\n\nRipper:\n-------\ndebpk77\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7864c966f6228b6ac71ea630a73acdcace917e21","amp;dn":"Feluda.30-AVCHD+rip-.BEN.Esubs+-+AC3.720p+-+DISC-1-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7864c966f6228b6ac71ea630a73acdcace917e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,100,201,102,246,34,139,106,199,30,166,48,167,58,205,202,206,145,126,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
