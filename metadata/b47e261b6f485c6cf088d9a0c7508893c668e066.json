Then a new couple moves in down the street, and Andrew finds himself falling for Nathan in a big way. Nathan is straight, married, and just about to be a father, but after one fateful night out together at a club, Nathan has to face the fact that his feelings for Andrew go way beyond that of a friend and neighbor.When Andrew's wife asks for a divorce, both men's lives are thrown into disarray. Arguments about their responsibilities to their wives and children, doubting themselves and each other, and some harrowing lies pull them apart... but they never leave each other's thoughts.\n\nVisit us at - www.lfrg.co.vu (currently under construction, but feel free to visit, and make sure you leave feedback for us)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b47e261b6f485c6cf088d9a0c7508893c668e066","amp;dn":"Sue+Brown+-Nothing+Ever+Happens+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b47e261b6f485c6cf088d9a0c7508893c668e066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,126,38,27,111,72,92,108,240,136,217,160,199,80,136,147,198,104,224,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
