A tale of  human inconstancy  expressed in  metaphysical conceits, rhetorical tropes and impossibilities, in the manner of  an assumed worldliness.  I have heard the mermaids singing...\n\nThe Argo recording from 1964 (PLP 1012), read with considerable authority by William Squire, Peter Orr and Richard Johnson. I add two items read by Eric Portman.
