(I got it from mininova.) I'm uploading it for a few reasons:\n\n-While the original torrent is reportedly &quot;in the piratebay system,&quot; I've yet to find it via searching. Hopefully this torrent will be found more readily.\n-The original torrent was zipped. This one is unzipped, and I added an .sfv file, just for kicks.\n-If I lose my hard drive ~and~ my flash drive gets smashed (and I lose my .torrents), I want to be able to get it from piratebay. :P\n\n\nRemember...\n\nKnowledge &gt; cynicism, any day of the week.\n\nbRz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a509f6d11983ffab77ec781c9f7dd01dd33901c7","amp;dn":"John+Kenneth+Galbraith+-+The+Great+Crash+%5B40kbps+audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a509f6d11983ffab77ec781c9f7dd01dd33901c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,9,246,209,25,131,255,171,119,236,120,28,159,125,208,29,211,57,1,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
