William Gill, Klaus Nobel, RAAF Sqdn Ldr White, Ray Palmer and Colin Cameron.\n\nThis amazing UFO documentary film was produced in 1977.  It was way ahead of its time.  Sadly, the master copies of this film and the two which followed it have been lost to the ravages of time.  Only one VHS copy of it survived; so Channel 9 gave us permission to convert it to digital video in an effort to preserve it as an archive for the use of posterity.\n\nThis film inspired Stan Deyo to write &quot;The Cosmic Conspiracy&quot; book which is the sequel to the shows.  The man-made, flying saucer programs are exposed in the book and the film.\n\n\nWeb site: http://www.standeyo.com/ - The Millenium Ark\n\nThis DVD can be purchased at this website, as well as Stan Deyo's acclaimed books &quot;The Cosmic Conspiracy&quot; and &quot;The Vindicator Scrolls&quot;.  Also of interest and importance are Stan and Holly Deyo's &quot;Prudent Places&quot; CD-ROM and &quot;Dare to Prepare&quot; book @ http://standeyo.com/Our_Books/Our_Books.html\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe Cosmic Conspiracy - Millenium Edition\n\n[img]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae194/geogaddi00/02.jpg[/img]\n\nRecruited by the Illuminati, Stan Deyo was taken secretly to Australia in 1971 to design &quot;flying saucer&quot; propulsion systems with them. Deyo reveals years later why &quot;they&quot; keep the alien/UFO agenda from the public. Many have investigated this huge conspiracy from the outside looking in - BUT, only one has come forward from an insider's perspective. Stan Deyo's The Cosmic Conspiracy is his testimony to you who would know the truth.... \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSECTION I: Flights of Reasons\nCHAPTER 1 - Sightings and Suspicions\nCHAPTER 2 - Electro-Gravitic Propulsion\nCHAPTER 3 - Constructs of Reality\nCHAPTER 4 - Radiant Genius: Tesla\nCHAPTER 5 - Effecting Weather Warfare\nCHAPTER 6 - The 1982 Alignments\n\nSECTION II: Mysticism and Numerology: Mystery Babylon\nCHAPTER 1 - Centuries Of Darkness\nCHAPTER 2 - Orders of Illuminism\nCHAPTER 3 - Seal of Deception\nCHAPTER 4 - Model For 'Peace'\nCHAPTER 5 - It's All Happening\nCHAPTER 6 - Circles of Illuminati\n\nSECTION III: Not Of Earth: Ichthus\nCHAPTER 1 - In the Beginning\nCHAPTER 2 - Conflicts Bear Witness\nCHAPTER 3 - How to Survive\nCHAPTER 4 - Taken to Safety\nCHAPTER 5 - Horror With Grace\nCHAPTER 6 - Until Sin Dies\nCHAPTER 7 - Spread the Word\n\n'Survival Kit': Reading List For Section III\nAppendix No. 1 - New York Herald Tribune articles\nAppendix No. 2 - Interavia Electro-Gravitics article\nAppendix No. 3 - The Gravitics Situation (Gravity Rand Ltd.)\nAppendix No. 4 - Copies of the Maxfield-Teller letters\nAppendix No. 5 - Einstein's Relativity Error\nAppendix No. 6 - Electrodynamic Propulsion\nAppendix No. 7 - Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System\n\nMillennium Revision\n\n(excerpts available here: http://web.archive.org/web/20070909114317/http://au.geocities.com/psyberplasmic/index.html )\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b785679b52472051288e11fcb31fa3c66498a6","amp;dn":"UFOs+Are+Here%21+%281977%29+Stan+Deyo%2C+Jacques+Vallee%2C+Steven+Spielber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b785679b52472051288e11fcb31fa3c66498a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,183,133,103,155,82,71,32,81,40,142,17,252,179,31,163,198,100,152,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
