It's a very old universe. Yet just 50 years since man first ventured into outer space, the heavens are yielding their greatest secrets. Robotic rovers give us eyes on the red rock of Mars--NASA probes slam into comets at hyper speed--deep-space telescopes capture violent images of the birth of stars and their collapse into black holes. All have significantly changed the way we see ourselves. We wonder, is there anywhere else out there that that can support life? Episodes examine how discoveries were made and the scientists and explorers who dared to venture into the uncharted territory of the universe.\nNetwork: History\nShow Airs: Tuesday at 9:00 PM for 60mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683a5af6f7f43882e651e8b6ae263604207b6b27","amp;dn":"The+Universe+S06E06.Worst+Days+on+Planet+Earth+HDTV+XviD-FQM%5Bett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683a5af6f7f43882e651e8b6ae263604207b6b27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,58,90,246,247,244,56,130,230,81,232,182,174,38,54,4,32,123,107,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
