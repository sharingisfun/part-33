TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.\n\nAs a guide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR2, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multithreaded code before.\n\nAbout the Author\nAnthony Williams is a UK-based developer and consultant with many years experience in C++. He has been an active member of the BSI C++ Standards Panel since 2001, and is author or coauthor of many of the C++ Standards Committee papers leading up to the inclusion of the thread library in the upcoming C++ Standard (known as C++0x). He has been the maintainer of the Boost Thread library since 2006, and is the developer of the just::thread implementation of the C++0x thread library from Just Software Solutions Ltd. Anthony lives in the far west of Cornwall, England.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 325 pages\nPublisher: Manning Publications; 1 edition (February, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1933988770\nISBN-13: 978-1933988771","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6cb93426a693993ee4081c911164ce5a71a059c","amp;dn":"Manning.CPlusPlus.Concurrency.in.Action.Aug.2010.MEAP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6cb93426a693993ee4081c911164ce5a71a059c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,203,147,66,106,105,57,147,238,64,129,201,17,22,76,229,167,26,5,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
