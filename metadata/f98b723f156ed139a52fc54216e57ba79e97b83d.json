It served as a general, non-technical resource focusing on cancer from the perspective of the social and behavioral sciences, exploring social and economic impacts, the â€œbusinessâ€ of cancer, advertising of drugs and treatment centers, how behavior change could offer great potential for cancer prevention, environmental risks, food additives and regulation, the relation between race and ethnicity and cancer risk, socioeconomic status, controversiesâ€”both scientific and politicalâ€”in cancer treatment and research, country-by-country entries on cancer around the world, and more. Given various developments in the field including new drug treatments, political controversies over use of the vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix with young girls to prevent cervical cancer, and unexpected upticks in the prevalence of adult smoking within the U.S. following decades of decline, the SAGE Encyclopedia of Cancer and Society, Second Edition serves as an updated and more current encyclopedia that addresses concerns pertaining to this topic.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\nÂ· Approximately half of the 700 first-edition articles revised and updated\r\nÂ· 30+ new entries covering new developments since 2006\r\nÂ· Signed entries with cross-references\r\nÂ· Further Readings accompanied by pedagogical elements\r\nÂ· New Readerâ€™s Guide\r\nÂ· Updated Chronology, Resource Guide, Glossary, and through new Index\r\n\r\nThe SAGE Encyclopedia of Cancer and Society, Second Edition serves as a reliable and precise source for students and researchers with an interest in social and behavioral sciences and seeks to better understand the continuously evolving subject matter of cancer and society.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nVolume 1\r\nList of Articles vi\r\nReaderâ€™s Guide xiv\r\nAbout the Editor xxii\r\nList of Contributors xxiii\r\nIntroduction xxx\r\nChronology xxxiii\r\nArticles\r\nA 1 B 119 C 199\r\nD 331 E 379 F 447\r\nVolume 2\r\nList of Articles vi\r\nReaderâ€™s Guide xiv\r\nArticles\r\nG 477 H 521 I 573 J 627 K 643\r\nL 657 M 719 N 793 O 849 P 879 R 967\r\nVolume 3\r\nList of Articles vi\r\nReaderâ€™s Guide xiv\r\nArticles\r\nS 1013 T 1135 U 1203 V 1271\r\nW 1297 X 1329 Y 1333 Z 1341\r\nGlossary 1345\r\nResource Guide 1373\r\nAppendix: SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975â€“2011 1379\r\nIndex 1483\r\n \nhttps://s33.postimg.org/sh0c3tzgf/The_SAGE_Encyclopedia_of_Cancer_and_Society.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98b723f156ed139a52fc54216e57ba79e97b83d","amp;dn":"The+SAGE+Encyclopedia+of+Cancer+and+Society+%28Vol.+1-3%29%282nd+Ed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f98b723f156ed139a52fc54216e57ba79e97b83d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,139,114,63,21,110,209,57,165,47,197,66,22,229,123,167,158,151,184,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
