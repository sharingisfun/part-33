Fiercely caustic\nyet still immediately accessible, Bleed It Out\nrepresents Linkin Park at the height of their powers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e277851dfc68f5b2259fdf1979445403cb2fbbd","amp;dn":"Linkin_Park-Bleed_It_Out-%28CDS%29-2007-SAW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e277851dfc68f5b2259fdf1979445403cb2fbbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,39,120,81,223,198,143,91,34,89,253,241,151,148,69,64,60,178,251,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
