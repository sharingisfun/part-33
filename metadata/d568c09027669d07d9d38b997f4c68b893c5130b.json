Hope's touch is lighter and his accenting is less emphatic.\n\nThis LP(CD) is new to the accurate rip database.\n\n\n\nMEDITATIONS  (Prestige label) was digitized and marketed in 1990 as part of \n\nthe OJC limited edition series which includes more than a few obscure treasures,\n\nalthough the sound quality of many of them is lacking IMO.  This one for example,\n\nsounds a bit thin and BASS WEAK to my ears.  I'll take it in any form I can get it.\n\nVintage jazz has a way of stressing out perfection-seeking audiophiles.  Clicks,\n\nPops, high noise floor, etc.......there's distractions a-plenty conspiring to\n\ndrive fanatics to purchase $500.00 line cords and other snake oils.  It's never\n\nenough.  60 year old recordings usually sound like it and your equalizer ain't\n\ngonna fix it.    \n\n\nWith audio, unlike most areas of interest...positive feedback is a bad thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d568c09027669d07d9d38b997f4c68b893c5130b","amp;dn":"ELMO+HOPE+trio%3B+Meditations%3B+%281955%29+OJC+limited+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d568c09027669d07d9d38b997f4c68b893c5130b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,104,192,144,39,102,157,7,217,211,139,153,127,76,104,184,147,197,19,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
