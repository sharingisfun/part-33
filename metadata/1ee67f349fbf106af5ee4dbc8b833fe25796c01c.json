I then digitized the video, did a two-pass noise reduction clean-up (unfortunately, about the first five minutes of the film are affected by some sort of Macrovision-type copy-defeating sound modulatioon that stops pretty quickly). Finally, I did a two-pass XviD encode in Gordian Knot, which gave me a file at the 576x384 resolution, with VBR MP3. I then cut the 1.24GB file into two smaller files (647MB and 628MB, respectively). The runtime of the film is just a little over an hour. I put the trailer included at the very end of the VHS tape through the same process and got a 74.8MB file at the same quality setting.\n\nI hope you enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed it when I first saw it (when I was very young).\n\n- NeoThe1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee67f349fbf106af5ee4dbc8b833fe25796c01c","amp;dn":"Flying+Phantom+Ship+%28Sora+tobu+yureisen%29+-+2+CD+%2B+Trailer+%5BXviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee67f349fbf106af5ee4dbc8b833fe25796c01c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,230,127,52,159,191,16,106,245,238,77,188,139,131,63,226,87,150,192,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
