It covers the entire spectrum of C3 (command, control and communications), intelligence, logistics and more. Combat is handled as a function of movement: the more MPs used in the attack, the more combat bonuses received. Many innovations, yet playable.\nDon't be deceived, however, this is a monster game in many senses of the word: it's not only big, but is intricately detailed. It's not for the faint of  heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c3dd60ccc43d8d88ea02bd65a36fb030b17b329","amp;dn":"NATO+Division+Commander+SPI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c3dd60ccc43d8d88ea02bd65a36fb030b17b329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,61,214,12,204,67,216,216,142,160,43,214,90,54,251,3,11,23,179,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
