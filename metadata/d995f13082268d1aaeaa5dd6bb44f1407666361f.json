Comprised of vocalist/guitarist Dan Young, guitarist Gavin Phillips, bassist/vocalist Phil Cobrea, and drummer Ryan Tapert, the group began gathering a decent local following while still in high school, playing in the same regional scene that spawned peers Gatsbys American Dream and Forgive Durden. The guys concurrently hooked up with Seattle-based Rocketstar Recordings, and following graduation, their full-length debut, Our Worlds Divorce, was released in late 2004. They toured around the country in support of the album with acts like Daphne Loves Derby, Sherwood, and Jenoah before eventually signing with Fueled by Ramen in early 2006. Teaming up again with producer Casey Bates (who'd also worked on their first album), This Providence's self-titled FBR debut appeared in September, as the band carried on with gigs opening for labelmates Paramore. Cobrea announced his resignation from the band that November, and he was soon replaced by Phoenix native David Blaise.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d995f13082268d1aaeaa5dd6bb44f1407666361f","amp;dn":"This+Providence+-+Our+Worlds+Divorce+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d995f13082268d1aaeaa5dd6bb44f1407666361f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,149,241,48,130,38,141,26,174,170,93,214,187,68,241,64,118,102,54,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
