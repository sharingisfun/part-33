In the deadly chaos of the First World War, one horse witnesses the reality of battle from both sides of the trenches. Bombarded by artillery, with bullets knocking riders from his back, Joey tells a powerful story of the truest friendships surviving in terrible times. 'The bedlam of battle had begun. All around me men cried and fell to the ground, and horses reared and screamed in an agony of fear and pain. The shells whined and roared overhead, and every explosion seemed like an earthquake to us.' One horse has seen the best and the worst of humanity. The power of war and the beauty of peace. This is his story. \nAbout the Author\nMichael Morpurgo has written over one hundred books and won many awards.
