The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).\nRecorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.\niZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.\n\nThis is A Lot of work folks!\n\n\n                                         Straight, No Chaser\n\n\nStraight, No Chaser is an album by jazz musician Thelonious Monk, released in 1967.\nThe album was reissued on CD in 1996, including restored versions of previously abridged performances and three additional tracks.\n\nThe song &quot;This Is My Story, This Is My Song&quot; is much better known by the title &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;.\n\n Track Listing (1996 Cd Reissue)\n\n   1. &quot;Locomotive&quot; - 6:40\n   2. &quot;I Didn't Know About You&quot; - 6:52\n   3. &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot; - 11:28\n   4. &quot;Japanese Folk Song (Kojo no Tsuki)&quot; - 16:42\n   5. &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; - 7:36\n   6. &quot;We See&quot; - 11:37\n   7. &quot;This Is My Story, This Is My Song&quot; - 1:42\n   8. &quot;I Didn't Know About You&quot; - 6:49\n   9. &quot;Green Chimneys&quot; - 6:34\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Thelonious Monk - piano\n    * Charlie Rouse - tenor sax\n    * Larry Gales - bass\n    * Ben Riley - drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf5553d9229f182045fc75c1e691e9926c02a65","amp;dn":"%7B24-96%7D+Thelonious+Monk+-+Straight%2C+No+Chaser+-+FLAC+320+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf5553d9229f182045fc75c1e691e9926c02a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,245,85,61,146,41,241,130,4,95,199,92,30,105,30,153,38,192,42,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
