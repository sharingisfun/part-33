Formerly known as the Bees (U.S.), the group formed in Nashville, TN, with John Deaderick (bass) and David Gehrke (drums) rounding out the lineup. The band's self-pressed debut disc, Starry Gazey Pie, was released in 2004 and received support from such influential radio stations as Boston's WFNX and L.A.'s KCRW. This, coupled with a national tour alongside Guster, enabled the group to release a follow-up, 2006's High Society. Cheap Lullaby signed the Bees (U.S.) in April 2007, and the Nashville band changed its name to the Silver Seas that September, citing a legal conflict with the British outfit A Band of Bees. The following month, Cheap Lullaby re-released High Society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c9f2d725ffbf4ebace485e0ea9bea45919dc7c","amp;dn":"The+Silver+Seas+-+Alaska+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0c9f2d725ffbf4ebace485e0ea9bea45919dc7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,201,242,215,37,255,191,78,186,206,72,94,14,169,190,164,89,25,220,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
