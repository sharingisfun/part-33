So I came up with a more entertaining way for tumblr to do it.\n\n1. Go into iTunes\n2. Right click the bar at the top that has all the things you can sort things by and turn on &quot;comments&quot;. \n3. Search &quot;Come on cutie gimme da booty&quot;\n4. Each song will have a number after it. This is the order in the playlist it should go. \n5. If you click &quot;comments&quot; at the top of the screen it will organize it by number for you. \n6. Select all, drag in to playlist\n7. Go The Fuck To Sleep. \n\n\n\nI'm uploading this here because I'm Zoey_Redbird, and my main account is used for discographies and I didn't want this to ruin it. Enjoy if you want it, fuck off if you don't. \n\nI love you all. Have fun sleeping. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4336a38d6a71b549f8a48dec7ca66926a1964928","amp;dn":"My+%26quot%3BGo+The+Fuck+To+Sleep%26quot%3B+Playlist.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4336a38d6a71b549f8a48dec7ca66926a1964928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,54,163,141,106,113,181,73,248,164,141,236,124,166,105,38,161,150,73,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
