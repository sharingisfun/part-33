Produced by Dobro ace Randy Kohrs, this collection of 12 originals showcases Lauderdale's distinctive vocals on tight bluegrass arrangements featuring a Nashville all-star band, including Tim Crouch on fiddle, Josh Williams on guitar, Aaron Ramsey on mandolin, Scott Vestal on banjo and Jay Weaver on bass. Jim Lauderdale is amulti-talented performer and songwriter, with success in both country and bluegrass music, and an international fan base. \nHe is a two-time GRAMMY award winner, Americana Association award winner, and is among Nashville's 'A' list of songwriters. He is also the co-host of SiriusXM's Buddy and Jim Show. \nHis songs have been covered by Patty Loveless, George Jones, The Dixie Chicks, Solomon Burke, Vince Gill and George Strait.
