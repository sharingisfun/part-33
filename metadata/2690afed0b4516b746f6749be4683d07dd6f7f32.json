Whether singing road songs such as &quot;Sinkemlow&quot; or the anthemic title track, Fallon emerges as the premier wordsmith of stoner rock on Pure Rock Fury. At the same time, unrelenting, driving grooves compel the listener effortlessly into Fallon's landscapes as deep, wide-open riffs swagger beneath wailing solos and pounding rhythms, again recalling the specter of Black Sabbath. Clutch's usual lineup is supplemented with number of cameos, including Scott Weinrich of Spirit Caravan. If Fallon's lyrics are obscure regarding the problem, on thing is made clear: &quot;Pure rock fury is the ultimate solution.&quot; This album delivers on its promise and then some as Clutch does what they do best -- and the best they've ever done it. -- Rich Goldman \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.American sleep [04:19] \n 02.Pure rock fury [03:22] \n 03.Open up the border [03:46] \n 04.Careful with that mic...
