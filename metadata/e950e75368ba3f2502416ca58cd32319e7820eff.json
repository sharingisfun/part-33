Their strategy includes passing education laws that encourage teaching creationism alongside evolution, and supporting school vouchers to transfer taxpayer money from public to private schools, where they can push a creationist agenda. But they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t count on 19-year-old anti-creationism activist Zack Kopplin.\n\nFrom the time he was a high school senior in his home state of Louisiana, Kopplin has been speaking, debating, cornering politicians and winning the active support of 78 Nobel Laureates, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the New Orleans City Council, and tens of thousands of students, teachers and others around the country. The Rice University history major joins Bill to talk about fighting the creep of creationist curricula into public school science classes and publicly funded vouchers that end up supporting creationist instruction.\n\nAlso on the program, journalist and historian Susan Jacoby talks with Bill about the role secularism and intellectual curiosity have played throughout AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, a topic explored in her new book, The Great Agnostic: Robert Ingersoll and American Freethought.\n\nLearn more about the production team behind Moyers &amp; Company.\n\nThe Lord Is Not on Trial Here Today courtesy of Jay Rosenstein Productions.\n- See more at: http://www.progressivetorrents.com/details.php?id=9941#sthash.03mUeMNM.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e950e75368ba3f2502416ca58cd32319e7820eff","amp;dn":"Fighting+Creeping+Creationism-Moyers+and+company-030113-ptc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e950e75368ba3f2502416ca58cd32319e7820eff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,80,231,83,104,186,63,37,2,65,108,165,140,211,35,25,231,130,14,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
