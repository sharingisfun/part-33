He may bear the green skull and have hundreds of seeders, but if you're getting this from him, you're missing out. You can find the material he posted anywhere, while this is the first lossless discography ever made available. If completeness and quality don't matter to you in favor of getting it from a self-righteous VIP, by all means, do what you wish. Torrenting is torrenting; one cannot be high and mighty by declaring an inferior quality will encourage album purchasing, particularly for abandoned albums.\n\n\n2.19: Thank you, seeders. You've kept this torrent alive while I was unable to, which shows just how much you guys care about All Time Low, and how god damn hard their Emerald Moon albums were to find. I've been following the band closely on their studio blog and their twitter accounts, and they're working hard on LP3, which I doubt you'll need me to help you get. Best of luck to you all in your own musical endeavors!\n\nOriginal: And people said it couldn't be done. Patrons of the internet, this collection has taken over four solid months to amass, and today marks its completion. The sheer amount of searching and pulled strings needed to bring together every song All Time Low has ever put on the market should be appreciated with your leeching and seeding alone (and maybe showing up at a few of their concerts for good measure). It is needless to say that this torrent is quite large, so do continue to seed, even if you're only a partial leecher. The songs All Time Low released over iTunes exclusively are lossy, as they have never been available on a disc. These are the only files that dip below the superb quality of AIFF (compressed losslessly to FLAC). This marks the end of All Time Low torrents as we know it... until this summer, when the new album drops. Can't wait.\n\n                  &quot;And it feels... like... I'm at an all-time low.&quot;\n\n                                                &quot;Head On Collision&quot;\n                                                    New Found Glory\n\nTrack listing:\n\n Poppin' (Video Mix)\n  (Released: 2008 (iTunes).
