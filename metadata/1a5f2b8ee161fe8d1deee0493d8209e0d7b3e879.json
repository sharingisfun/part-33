Folk music, pop songs, symphonies, modal, tonal, atonal, well-tempered and ill-tempered works all find a place in these discussions. \n\nEach, Mr. Bernstein suggests, has roots in a universal language central to all artistic creation. Using certain linguistic analogies, he explores the ways in which this language developed and can be understood as an aesthetic surface. Drawing on his insights as a master composer and conductor, Mr. Bernstein also explores what music means below the surface: the symbols and metaphors which exist in every musical piece, of whatever sort. \n\nFinally, Mr. Bernstein analyzes twentieth century crises in the music of Schoenberg and Stravinsky, finding even here a transformation of all that has gone before, as part of the poetry of expression, through its roots in the earth of human experience.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5f2b8ee161fe8d1deee0493d8209e0d7b3e879","amp;dn":"Leonard+Bernstein+-+Six+Harvard+Talks+About+Music+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5f2b8ee161fe8d1deee0493d8209e0d7b3e879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,95,43,142,225,97,254,141,29,238,224,73,61,130,9,224,215,179,232,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
