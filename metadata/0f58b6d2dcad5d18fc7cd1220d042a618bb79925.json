It just numbs the mind.\n\nBecause each lesson builds on the previous, it's ineffective and pointless to roll along watching the DVD.\n\nOutside of the water, individual lessons on the iPad work great for very young swimmers, particularly with water babies.\n\nTap, tap, tap, watch the drill on the iPad, get in the water, apply -- no DVD, no DVD player, no searching for the drill you want.\n\nTIF = Total Immersion Freestyle, L = lesson, D = drill, TIFSF = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle, TIFSFB = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle-Backstroke\n\nBecause both freestyle and backstroke are &quot;Long Axis&quot; (LA) strokes they are dealt with at the same time in the TIFSFB drills.\n\nV: m4v     H264/MPEG4    948 x 720     7055k     29.97fps\nA: mpeg4aac     6807k     243k     44100\n\nColor corrected, light levels sometimes adjusted, background noise removed when original was too extreme. Onscreen text has been added to the progressions because -- again -- too much too fast for us folks of only normal IQ.\n\nAnd we'll probably put together a VOCABULARY list for all these because -- GUESS WHAT? -- little kids do NOT understand everything Coach Terry is rattling on about.\n\nTHANKS FOR SEEDING!\n\nOur Entire iPad Optimized Collection (each a separate download):\n\nTIF L0 Help for Weak Kickers\nTIF L1D1 Balance on Your Back\nTIF L1D2 Sweet Spot\nTIF L1D3 Lengthen Your Vessel\nTIF L1D4 Fish Drill\nTIF L1D5 Skating\nTIF L2D6 UnderSkate\nTIF L2D7 UnderSwitch\nTIF L2D8 Double UnderSwitch\nTIF L2D9 Triple UnderSwitch\nTIF L3D10 ZipperSkate\nTIF L3D11 ZipperSwitch\nTIF L3D12 Multi-Zipper\nTIF L4 Learn to Swim as Well as you Drill\nTIF L4D14 Momentum Drills Push off to Skating\nTIF L5 Breathing 101\nTIF L6 Freestyle Turns Made Easy\nTIF L7 Swimming Fast\nTIF L8 Two Heads are Better than One\nSwimming - Fingertip Wall Drill (by Marc Evans, not TI)\nTIFSF L1 Master Basic Balance\nTIFSF L2 Balance on Your Back\nTIFSF L3 Find Your Sweet Spot\nTIFSF L4 Active Balance - Looking UP\nTIFSF L5 Active Balance - Looking DOWN\nTIFSF L6 Active Balance - Full Circle\nTIFSF L7 Hand-Lead Sweet Spot\nTIFSF L8 Kick in Skating Position\nTIFSF L9 Shark Fin\nTIFSF L10 Stop-Stop-Switch\nTIFSF L11 Triple Switch\nTIFSF L12 Single-Arm Freestyle\nTIFSFB L13 Slide and Guide\nTIFSFB L14 Single-Arm Backstroke\nTIFSFB L15 Alternating Single Arm\nTIFSFB L16 Sweet-Spot Combo\nTIFSFB L17 LA-Combo Swimming\nTIFSFB L18 LA-Combo Single Arm\nTIFSFB L19 Long-Axis Progression 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f58b6d2dcad5d18fc7cd1220d042a618bb79925","amp;dn":"Total+Immersion+4+Strokes+Made+EZ+L7+Hand-Lead+Sweet+Spot+-+iPAD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f58b6d2dcad5d18fc7cd1220d042a618bb79925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,88,182,210,220,173,93,24,252,124,209,34,13,4,42,97,139,183,153,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
