She's bored and lacks things to do and is sick and tired of living there. She hears of Sound, a new disco in the city center, called the most modern discothÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨que in Europe. Although she's legally too young to go to the disco, she dresses up in high heels and make-up and asks a friend from school to take her. At the disco she meets Detlef, who is a little older. He is in a clique where everybody is experimenting with various drugs. At first she takes pills and trips, but gradually she becomes drawn deeper into the drugs, eventually ending up as a heroin-addict and prostitute.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2528ce0ef2f84bc729ed57d81edaa1ca63bff90e","amp;dn":"Christiane+F+-+Wir+Kinder+Vom+Bahnhof+Zoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2528ce0ef2f84bc729ed57d81edaa1ca63bff90e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,40,206,14,242,248,75,199,41,237,87,216,30,218,161,202,99,191,249,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
