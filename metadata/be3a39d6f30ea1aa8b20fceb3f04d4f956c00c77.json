You can&amp;#039;t just tell it to download to a folder and they get shared - they do not get shared unless you also set up a sharing folder. Most P2P apps will share your &quot;incoming&quot; folder automatically, Nicotine+ doesn&amp;#039;t do this unless you tell it to, so bear it in mind because people will ban you on principle from downloading from them, if you do not share!\n\n2 - When you run this portable version, type your user name and password in. \n\n3 - After that, close the program. Then open the program again. This will save the user name and password and you are connected now, you can search, download and so on.\n\n4 - The default &quot;Incomplete file directory&quot; is alongside the portable application:\nNicPlus%ProgramFilesDir%Nicotine+Downloads-Incomplete\n\nThe default &quot;Download directory&quot; is alongside the portable application:\nNicPlus%ProgramFilesDir%Nicotine+Downloads-Finished\n\nYou can change these if you want, but make sure to close and restart the program.\n\n5 - Chat rooms - to make it &quot;save&quot; a chat room (re-connect to the chat room when the program starts) make sure you tick &quot;Auto Join&quot; on the right of the chat window. You can untick the &quot;Nicotine&quot; chat room if you wish, no one in there knows about music BTW.\n\n6 - When you close this program you always get an error - saying look in a &quot;logfile&quot; but just ignore this error. Also ignore how the tray icon stays there after the program is closed, it doesn&amp;#039;t matter, many programs do that, I would blame Windows (not refreshing task bar properly) more than the program.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nEXE file MD5:\n7A44056FABFDCF7969BDACA97B540F97\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget To Join The Forum @ SnipeR&amp;#039;s Redemption Network:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.retestrak.nl/Board/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.retestrak.nl/Board/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy this fine release from eXPerience\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3a39d6f30ea1aa8b20fceb3f04d4f956c00c77","amp;dn":"Nicotine%2B+1.2.9+with+internal+GTK%2B2+%28alt.+Soulseek%29+-+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3a39d6f30ea1aa8b20fceb3f04d4f956c00c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,58,57,214,243,14,161,170,139,32,252,235,63,4,212,249,86,192,12,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
