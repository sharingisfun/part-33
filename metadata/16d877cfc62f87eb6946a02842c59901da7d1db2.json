Holly Golightly lives in an apartment in New York City.  Her \nlive-in companion is an orange tabby named \\&quot;Cat\\&quot; because she feels that they \ndon\\&amp;#039;t really belong to each other and to give the cat an actual name would \nacknowledge that they have a lasting relationship.\nThe main plot of the movie is Holly\\&amp;#039;s relationship with neighbor Paul Varjak, \nwho has confidence problems of his own. The story explores the relationship \nbetween Holly and Paul, Holly and her other paramours, and the resolution that \noccurs within Holly\\&amp;#039;s own mind and between Holly and Paul. The film includes \nAudrey Hepburn singing the original performance of \\&quot;Moon River\\&quot; and the \nfamous closing sequence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16d877cfc62f87eb6946a02842c59901da7d1db2","amp;dn":"Breakfast.At.Tiffanys.1961.PAL.DVDR.Multisubs-DiSHON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16d877cfc62f87eb6946a02842c59901da7d1db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,216,119,207,198,47,135,235,105,70,160,40,66,197,153,1,218,125,29,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
