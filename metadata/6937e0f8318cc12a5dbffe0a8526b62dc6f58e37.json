She has studied at the Eric SahlstrÃƒÂ¶m Institute, where she is now a board member, and has a BA in musicology and composition from the NTNU in Trondheim, as well as a BA in Swedish folk music from the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and a Nordic Master in folk music from the same institution in conjunction with the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Southern Denmark and the Ole Bull Academy in Norway.\n\nShe has performed in many European countries as well as in China, the USA, Canada, Namibia, India and Brazil, both solo and with folk music groups such as ODE, Skaran and Blink, as well as performing as soloist with the Trondheim Soloists. She has also performed with Persian, Kurdish and Indian musicians and with pop/rock and jazz musicians (including Jon Lord, Deep Purple's former keyboardist, who wrote a song for her). With the Trondheim Soloists, Gjermund Larsen and 2L and the album In folk style she won a Norwegian Spellemannspris in 2010 for the best classical album and was nominated for two US Grammy Awards. The same year she was proclaimed world champion on the nyckelharpa, and in 2011 she was nominated Artist of the year at the Swedish Folk and World Music Awards.\n\nSince the autumn of 2011 Emilia is working full time as a freelance musician, singer, composer and teacher. In December 2012 her critically acclaimed solo debut TrollfÃƒÂ¥geln was released at the venerable classical record label BIS Records, with traditional and new composed music by Emilia, for nyckelharpa, voice, folk music ensemble and string quintet. In the beginning of 2013 TrollfÃƒÂ¥geln was nominated for the Swedish Grammy Awards Grammis, for the Manifest awards, and for Album of the Year at the Swedish Folk and World Music Awards. Emilia won Artist of the Year at the Swedish Folk and World Music Awards and RESiDANS, where Emilia is a musician in the dance performance Dans med vuxna, won Mixed project (TvÃƒÂ¤rspel) of the Year.
