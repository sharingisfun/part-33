On Ready 'n Able, Rosenberg mixes originals (the Joe Pass-meets-Segovia &quot;Listen&quot; is astounding) with tunes by Charlie Parker (&quot;Relaxing at Camarillo&quot;), Stevie Wonder (&quot;I Wish&quot;), and soul-jazz organist Jimmy Smith (&quot;Ready 'n Able&quot;). Toss in such classics as &quot;Djangology,&quot; &quot;All the Things You Are,&quot; and &quot;Body and Soul,&quot; and you have the ingredients for an eclectic, deeply satisfying jazz-guitar experience. Skillfully accompanied by guitarist and younger brother Mozes (who contributes wonderful solos of his own) and upright bassist Sani Van Mullem, Rosenberg delivers blistering arpeggios and runs with a quivering vibrato and lightning speed worthy of Mr. Reinhardt himself. Armed with vintage Selmer and modern LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©o Eimers 6-strings, Rosenberg makes genuine jazz manouche that sounds fresh, yet timeless.&quot;\n\nTracks:\n01. Joseph's Tiger\n02.
