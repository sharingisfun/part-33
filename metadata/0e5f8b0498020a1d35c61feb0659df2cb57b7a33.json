Park, &quot;Bioactive Components in Milk and Dairy Products&quot;\nPublisher: W***y-Bla...ell | ISBN: 0813819822 | 2012 | PDF | 439 pages | 4.2 MB\n\nAlthough bioactive compounds in milk and dairy products have been extensively studied during the last few decades Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially in human and bovine milks and some dairy products Ã¢â‚¬â€œ very few publications on this topic are available, especially in other dairy speciesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ milk and their processed dairy products. Also, little is available in the areas of bioactive and nutraceutical compounds in bovine and human milks, while books on other mammalian species are non-existent.\n\nBioactive Components in Milk and Dairy Products extensively covers the bioactive components in milk and dairy products of many dairy species, including cows, goats, buffalo, sheep, horse, camel, and other minor species. Park has assembled a group of internationally reputed scientists in the forefront of functional milk and dairy products, food science and technology as contributors to this unique book.\n\nCoverage for each of the various dairy species includes: bioactive proteins and peptides; bioactive lipid components; oligosaccharides; growth factors; and other minor bioactive compounds, such as minerals, vitamins, hormones and nucleotides, etc. Bioactive components are discussed for manufactured dairy products, such as caseins, caseinates, and cheeses; yogurt products; koumiss and kefir; and whey products.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5f8b0498020a1d35c61feb0659df2cb57b7a33","amp;dn":"Bioactive+Components+in+Milk+and+Dairy+Products","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5f8b0498020a1d35c61feb0659df2cb57b7a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,95,139,4,152,2,10,29,53,198,31,235,6,89,223,44,181,123,122,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
