The band is part of the Cardiff music scene and were at their most prominent during the 1990s. They are colloquially known as 'The Manics' or simply 'Manics'. Manic Street Preachers were originally a quartet but primary lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards vanished on 1 February 1995.\n\nIn 1992, the Manics released their debut album, Generation Terrorists. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery and critical social lyrics about 'culture, alienation, boredom, and despair' soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums retained a leftist politicisation and intellectual lyrical style while adopting a broader alternative rock sound.\n\nFollowing Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire persisted with Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success, becoming one of Britain's premier rock bands. Altogether, they have garnered eight Top 10 albums, fifteen Top 10 singles, and have reached number one three times with their 1998 This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours album, the 1998 'If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next' single, and the 2000 'The Masses Against the Classes' single.
