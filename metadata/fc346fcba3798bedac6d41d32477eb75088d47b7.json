But when Chapman's musical soulmate, acclaimed singer-songwriter Tim Krekel, suddenly succumbed to cancer in 2009, her plans were dashed. The period of mourning that followed has produced a remarkable collection of songs, a concept album about grief in the vein of Rosanne CashÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Black Cadillac.\n\nLike Cash, Chapman wisely keeps her sorrow grounded in specific images instead of broad themes. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that sound/ like something falling through the trees,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she laments in the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s centerpiece, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Falling Through the Trees,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song so rich in metaphor that it demands multiple listenings.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bit of a departure for the raucous ChapmanÃ¢â‚¬â€who was once advised by Jerry Lee Lewis to not burn outÃ¢â‚¬â€allowing her trademark piss-Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢-vinegar sound to be tempered by a quiet melancholy. The result is a country album in the classic sense, full of heartache and longing. Big Lonesome might just be ChapmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc346fcba3798bedac6d41d32477eb75088d47b7","amp;dn":"Marshall+Chapman+-+Big+Lonesome+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc346fcba3798bedac6d41d32477eb75088d47b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,52,111,203,163,121,139,237,172,109,65,211,36,119,235,117,8,141,71,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
