It includes the &quot;4th Hour&quot; with Pat &amp; Stu which is available only to subscribers (ie. it is not part of the regular radio broadcast).\n\n\nWhere did the last few days go!!?? Oh well, it's Christmas and on Thursday it was Doc Thompson filling in for Glenn. I guess everyone was busy for Christmas since you weren't all screaming about where the posts had disappeared to!\n\nI had some trouble uploading these two days to TPB, but I had posted to kickass and demonoid.  I always cross post to both of those sites, so if you're desperate, you can find them.\n\nRESIST WE MUCH!
