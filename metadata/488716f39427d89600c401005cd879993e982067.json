The men of the bomber crews did not enjoy the luxury of combat tours ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they flew until they died or became unfit for combat duty. This book studies the attitudes, beliefs and motivation of the average crewman, following him through recruitment and training to experience on campaign in western Europe, Africa and the Russian front during World War II (1939-1945), detailing the exploits and trials of the famous Ju 87 'Stuka' dive-bomber crews and their own crucial part in Germany's war effort.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nRobert Stedman is a regular contributor to international militaria magazines and works as a military advisor to TV, film and theatre.
