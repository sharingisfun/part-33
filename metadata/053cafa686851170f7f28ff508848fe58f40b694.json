They work on computers, Xbox 360, PS3, WDHD TV/Live, media servers, some Blu ray players and some upscaling DVD players.==-\n\n* We believe it is better to test quality with a sample, which we always provide. It's a much better representation of what the release will look like on your TV/monitor.\n\n* Subtitles are provided as often as possible but sometimes the source doesn't include them. If you desperately want subs, there are plenty of places they can be found. Just ensure the run time is the same. \n\n* Sony does watermark their releases with Cinavia meaning the audio will cut out at some point. This has nothing to do with us or any other encoding group. If you want to check to see if a release is Cinavia protected, google Cinavia Wiki and check to see which releases are affected.\n\n* Yes, our releases are 720p or 1080p. We just don't waste space by encoding the black bars. If you don't understand this, do research on aspect ratio. The source files are the same or proportionate resolution. \n\n* Comments are meant to thank the encoder and discuss the encode, not for unintelligently bashing the movie itself. If you can't say anything useful, move on. Films should be judged on what they are intended to do, not what you want them to do for you. \n\n* In most cases, we do rar our releases. People who are educated about what seedboxes are understand why. Also, you can seed pieces of an upload without having to download all the files. For quite some time now, all our rars can still be watched using players such as VLC without extraction. This means, you don't have to use up twice the space on your hard drive while seeding if that is a concern.\n\n* If you have problems extracting files, check your files thoroughly before making any comments claiming it's a bad download. Ask someone else to check also. We test our files properly before sharing them with you.\n\n* Thanks to those who respect and appreciate the work that goes into this process! \n\n================================================================\n\nSource: Burning.Man.2011.720p.BluRay.x264-aAF\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 3031M\nPlayTime           : 01:50:06.333\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 1280 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 544 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 24fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 50097\nVideoBitRate       : 3195985\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : AC3\nAudioBitRate       : 640000\nAudioChannels      : 6\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1570559/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1570559/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAn English chef with a chic restaurant on Bondi Beach trying to put his life and his relationship with his son back on track while surrounded by women.\n\nspecially Greetz to Hero not like rars\n\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:053cafa686851170f7f28ff508848fe58f40b694","amp;dn":"Burning+Man+2011+BRRip+XvidHD+720p-NPW%28Murlok%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"053cafa686851170f7f28ff508848fe58f40b694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,60,175,166,134,133,17,112,247,242,143,245,8,132,143,229,143,64,182,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
