Her ex tells her that she must apply to a &quot;housework&quot; club before he will reconsider going out with her. Therefore Reo-chan has little choice but to join.\n\nHere's the catch: the only members are four gorgeous bishies. The other first year in the club, Irinaka, competes with her a lot. As the story progresses Reo and Irinaka get forced into a lot of interesting situations together and in the meantime become closer and closer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d9000eb2c76fe6e227ab2a4db9f3c748006e82","amp;dn":"Nadeshiko+Club+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d9000eb2c76fe6e227ab2a4db9f3c748006e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,217,0,14,178,199,111,230,226,39,171,42,77,185,243,199,72,0,110,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
