I really love how each of their albums have progressively changed, yet they all sound amazing on their own.\n\n\n\n[2007] Here, The End (~273kbps)\n\n01 Casting Light Through Such Thin Shades\n02 The Residuum\n03 (Grace) We Are The Heirs!\n04 Verily I Say, Unto You\n05 Of Water And The Spirit\n06 My Path, Ascending\n07 Kyle\n08 If, And Only If\n09 The Human Project Lives\n10 Yea, The Cold Embrace Of The Sea\n11 Here, The End\n\n\n \n[2009] The Everlasting Man (320kbps)\n\n01 The Covenant\n02 Iniquity: An Offering\n03 Affliction: The Witness, The Advocate\n04 Infidelity: Kingdom's End\n05 The Exile\n06 Babylon: The Insatiable Thirst\n07 Absolution: Of Flight and Failure\n08 Masada: The Spiral Staircase\n09 Restoration: The Return From Exile\n10 Redemption: A Grief Observed\n11 The Thousand Years\n\n\n\n[2010] Realis (320kbps)\n\n01 Nightfall\n02 The Overman\n03 Withering Branches\n04 The Machine Stops\n05 No Light\n06 Post Tenebras Lux\n07 First Light Of Dawn\n08 The Crippling Fear\n09 The Warmth Of The Heavens\n10 Seasons\n11 Ascension\n12 After\n\n\n\n[2011] In Abstraction (320kbps)\n\n01 Calm\n02 Out Of Ruin, Misery\n03 Firewind\n04 Tides\n05 The House Where You Were Born\n06 Weaved\n07 Everything That Rises Must Converge\n\n\n\nA Hope for Home (commonly abbreviated to AHFH) is a band based in Portland, Oregon that formed in 2006. They have 3 studio albums, two of which were released on Facedown Records and Strike First (the imprint label of Facedown Records). Throughout their career, A Hope for Home has controlled many of the aspects of their music including the recording, production, mixing, art direction, and art design. These commitments have allowed them to achieve the precise sound and imagery of their intentions, and have become part of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic. \n\n\n\n\nP.S. \nI've also included the bonus DVD from the album In Abstraction. You can find the trailer on YT if you're interested in watching it. I recommend you do after listening to the album.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:306e3fa0d38808291daa22886ca885560e7883f9","amp;dn":"A+Hope+For+Home+-+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"306e3fa0d38808291daa22886ca885560e7883f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,110,63,160,211,136,8,41,29,170,34,136,108,168,133,86,14,120,131,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
