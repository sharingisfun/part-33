Virtual Energy (Dreamix)\n\n\n\nIf you were in the party/rave scene in the late 1990's to around 2004 then this will absolutely make your day. This is such a rare album. I personally believe that this CD should have made its way into the top ten at some point. But for some reason nobody has even really heard of it. My friend Taylor Grangroth is the one who introduced me to this. And I have loved it ever since. And I'm sure once you hear it you will absolutely love it also. \n\n\nBrought to you by DJ~Tripp Aka David Elliott\n\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nSeed\n\nAnd remember &quot;Sharing is caring&quot;!!!!
