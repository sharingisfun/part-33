In the last year of his life, Dr. King announced the Poor PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Campaign to demand an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Economic Bill of RightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for all Americans, regardless of color. But nearly a half-century later, that dream is still a dream deferred. Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch and author and theologian James Cone join Bill to discuss Dr. KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision of economic justice, and why so little has changed for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most oppressed.\n\nAlso on the show, poet Kyle Dargan talks about his efforts to reconcile disparate cultural environments through poetry.\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422abc2e25384e82154362c4e143601a522067d1","amp;dn":"MLK%26rsquo%3Bs+Dream+of+Economic+Justice-PBS+Moyers+and+Company+040","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422abc2e25384e82154362c4e143601a522067d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,42,188,46,37,56,78,130,21,67,98,196,225,67,96,26,82,32,103,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
