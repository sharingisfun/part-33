Hoping to find a new direction, he enrolls in a night class called The Fundamentals of Caregiving, where he will learn to take care of people with disabilities. He is instructed about professionalism, about how to keep an emotional distance between client and provider, and about the art of inserting catheters while avoiding liability. But when Ben is assigned his first client--a tyrannical nineteen-year-old boy named Trevor, who is in the advanced stages of Duchenne muscular dystrophy--he soon discovers that the endless service checklists have done nothing to prepare him for the reality of caring for a fiercely stubborn, sexually frustrated teenager who has an ax to grind with the whole world.\r\n\r\nOver time, the relationship between Ben and Trev, which had begun with mutual misgivings, evolves into a close friendship, and the traditional boundaries between patient and caregiver begin to blur. The bond between them strengthens as they embark on a road trip to visit Trevâ€™s ailing father--a journey rerouted by a series of bizarre roadside attractions that propel them into an impulsive adventure disrupted by one birth, two arrests, a freakish dust storm, and a six-hundred-mile cat-and-mouse pursuit by a mysterious brown Buick Skylark. By the end of that journey, Trev has had his first taste of love, and Ben has found a new reason to love life.\r\n\r\nBursting with energy and filled with moments of absolute beauty, this big-hearted and inspired novel ponders lifeâ€™s terrible surprises as well as what it takes to truly care for another human being","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d63f1c3dd19c826bf45202b12fd12c2c48edc5f","amp;dn":"The+Revised+Fundamentals+of+Caregiving+-+Jonathan+Evison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d63f1c3dd19c826bf45202b12fd12c2c48edc5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,99,241,195,221,25,200,38,191,69,32,43,18,253,18,194,196,142,220,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
