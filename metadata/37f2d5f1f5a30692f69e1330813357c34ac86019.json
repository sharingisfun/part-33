Now this lone hero is about to come face to face with another kind of legend-one that stalks the woods of northern California...\n\nHalf Man, Half Beast, All Terror\n\nIt kills like an animal. Growling Clawing. Ripping. The loggers call it &quot;The Terror of the Redwoods.&quot; A local timber baron has put a bounty on the hide of this man-beast, and the woods are teeming with so many trigger-happy dolts and half-cocked drunkards that someone's bound to get hurt-and bad. Frank Morgan doesn't believe in such creatures and decides to get to the bottom of this tall tale. But when he meets the timber baron's beautiful daughter, all bets are off.
