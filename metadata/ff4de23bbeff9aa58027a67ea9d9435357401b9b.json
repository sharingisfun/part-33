Written based off an outline of the events of VirgilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Aeneid scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin by a drunk, The Vagina Ass of Lucifer Niggerbastard is an epic tale told in a bizarro-authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take on the ancient Homeric masters. Hey, all writers are thieves. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just illegal if the dead author you steal from hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t rotted enough yet. Actually, this book is pretty much nothing like the Aeneid. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more like the Odyssey, only more fucked up, more epic, and definitely more interesting to read. Is it a commentary on how fucked up things are yet again? Maybe. Probably. Yes. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a sense of humor or Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad wordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ get your ass in a twist, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t read this fucking book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff4de23bbeff9aa58027a67ea9d9435357401b9b","amp;dn":"The+Vagina+Ass+of+Lucifer+Niggerbastard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff4de23bbeff9aa58027a67ea9d9435357401b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,77,226,59,190,255,154,165,128,39,166,126,169,217,67,83,87,64,27,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
