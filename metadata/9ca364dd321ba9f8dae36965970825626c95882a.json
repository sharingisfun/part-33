Galloran, a blind king who once searched for the word himself, introduces Jason to Rachel, another Beyonder (as people from Earth are called) who had appeared in Lyrian at the same time. Jason and Rachel set out to retrieve the word, and the resulting pages are filled with adventure, drama, loyalty and betrayalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a treat for fans of MullÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Fablehaven series or those discovering this bestselling author for the first time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca364dd321ba9f8dae36965970825626c95882a","amp;dn":"A+World+Without+Heroes+%28Beyonders%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca364dd321ba9f8dae36965970825626c95882a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,163,100,221,50,27,169,248,218,227,105,101,151,8,37,98,108,149,136,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
