It ran from 1985 to 1989 for sixteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology. Described by Dez Skinn in Comix The Underground Revolution as the work which &quot;threw Peter Bagge into the limelight&quot;, Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradleys characters story in Hate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0704713170a2db81892dc24e99d2ad857c7e0e88","amp;dn":"Peter+Bagge+-+Neat+Stuff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0704713170a2db81892dc24e99d2ad857c7e0e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,4,113,49,112,162,219,129,137,45,194,78,153,210,173,133,124,126,14,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
