With nothing to lose, she sails to New York to find the man who turned a cold shoulder to her motherâ€™s suffering: Carolineâ€™s grandfather. To settle the family score, Caroline infiltrates her grandfatherâ€™s privileged world, hoping to sabotage his business from the inside. But as she sets her plot in motion, she meets Jackson Montgomery, a virtuous man who is struggling to recover from a family scandal of his own. As their friendship grows, and Caroline begins to piece together the motives that led her family to turn its back, she is forced to make a decision: Should she risk everything in the name of justice? Or can she look toward the future and let love and forgiveness guide her instead?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2b2efd6cb34677fa97023f122d8e8ecbcb7a8e1","amp;dn":"Journey%27s+End+%28Gilded+Promises%29+by+Renee+Ryan+%28ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2b2efd6cb34677fa97023f122d8e8ecbcb7a8e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,178,239,214,203,52,103,127,169,112,35,241,34,216,232,236,188,183,168,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
