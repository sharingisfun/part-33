Timeless and paramount in this Healing and Inner Growth category is the Psycho-Sensory Integration Set of six (6) programs.\n\nFor the Therapist and Client\n\nThe PsychoSensory Integration Set (PSI) was created to assist psychotherapists and clinical hypnotherapists and clients alike to facilitate and enrich therapy and its effects, to create a bonding and safe environment to heal. From his understanding of psychology and how a person is best assisted to release emotional issues and heal in a safe and effective manner, making results long lasting, Dr. Thompson created a very specific type of music.\n\nNon-Linear Music\n\nThis was the creation of Dr. ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Non-Linear&quot; Music. This is music that does not follow the ordinary sequence of western musical expectations of chord changes, which leads to anticipated musical conclusions. His &quot;Non-Linear&quot; Music stays in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“nowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It stays in the present tense, encouraging the listener to relax and feel safe. The listener does not need to expect, consciously or subconsciously, any musical conclusions.\n\nThis new type of ambient music was combined with brainwave entrainment techniques and Dr. ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proprietary formula for composing and creating gentle but powerful soundscapes. The brain state of Theta was used, being the brain state where emotional healing and subsequent release is possible. It is the state in which emotions are healed and balanced. With specific Dr. Thompson formatted &quot;Primordial Sounds,&quot; a subconscious mind response was enhanced. A powerful new tool for healing and growth was born. The set was eagerly accepted and used by therapists across the globe. In music and approach was able to Ã¢â‚¬Å“pushÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the envelope of emotional release and inner health in a safe, effective and pleasant manner.\n\nSeparate Soundtracks\n\nThere are six separate PSI soundtracks. Each is designed for emotional release and empathic bonding, creating different emotional Ã¢â‚¬Å“MoodScapesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Each offers a different mode for balancing the Body/Heart/Mind/Spirit interplay. This current PSI set is the non-prescription set, released to the general public and capable of accomplishing the goals and objectives for which it was designed, that of health, wellness and personal growth.\n\nHow to Use\n\nYou will want to use each program in orderÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 1,2, 3 etc if creating a therapeutic opportunity for yourself. Using one program for a week or more is found very helpful. You may be very pleasantly surprised with the inner work you are able to accomplish.\n\nOnce you have used each of the programs in order, it is suggested you return to the first program and use that for a week, followed by #2 for a week, #3 for a week, etc. Growth and awareness is continuous, easily seen when one journals, which is highly recommended. You will likely be pleased with your newly found awareness, clearing and balance.\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nAll tracks secure rips, 5 AccurateRip verified.
