Through the story of each family member -- a wrathful father, a mettlesome mother, and three very different sons and the memorable women they marry, Doig conveys a sense of time and place that is at once epic in scope and rich in detail.\n\nAround this eye-of-the-cyclone family swirls the epic that was Fort Peck &amp; its cast of thousands -- con men &amp; G-men, politicos &amp; prostitutes, drawn by the workers who labored above, below &amp; beside the river, through sweltering heat &amp; winters so savage ice formed inside their shanties. And always, there is the river, restlessly eddying toward a tragedy that will entrap some &amp; pardon others. &quot;I have long felt about Ivan Doig's books much as Will Rogers must have felt about his fellow human beings -- I've never met one I didn't like. Doig has concentrated his immense writing talents on telling this epic tale.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:410984ec8cd624a6d4130aac93170cb3f384d23e","amp;dn":"Ivan+Doig-Bucking+the+Sun+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"410984ec8cd624a6d4130aac93170cb3f384d23e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,9,132,236,140,214,36,166,212,19,10,172,147,23,12,179,243,132,210,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
