During a recent tour of Dubai, Peters sold tickets at the rate of one ticket every two seconds Ã¢â‚¬â€ crashing all the online sales outlets as soon as the tickets went on-sale. In February 2008, Peters became one of only a handful of comedians to headline and sell out the world-famous Madison Square Garden. In 2009, he set a new UK attendance record for the highest attended comedy show in their history, with over 16,000 fans attending his O2 Arena show. Peters uses his wry and funny observations about race, class and culture to illuminate our human shortcomings. His quick wit and gift for mimicking languages and accents allows him to create characters of all races and cultures, regardless of their cultural background. Over the course of his twenty-year career, he has headlined comedy festivals throughout North America and abroad. In recent years, he has performed sold-out arena tours in the United States, Canada, India, China, South Africa, Australia, the UK, Singapore, Sweden, Norway, The UAE, Lebanon and the Philippines. \n\n\nHardcover: 240 pages\nPublisher: Doubleday Canada (October 26, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0385669631\nISBN-13: 978-0385669634\n-your pal parafizz:) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:783301b890dad829af290068d3b353076678ea44","amp;dn":"Call+Me+Russell+-By+Russell+Peters+%28+International+Edition%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"783301b890dad829af290068d3b353076678ea44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,51,1,184,144,218,216,41,175,41,0,104,211,179,83,7,102,120,234,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
