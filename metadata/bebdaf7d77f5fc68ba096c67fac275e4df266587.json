The only other substances which we\nclassed as hallucinogens were the active principals from marijuana,\nharmala alkaloids, and ibogain, not at that time identified chemically\nfor certain. In the past decade so many additional hallucinogens have\nbeen discovered, studied, and described and so many new publications\nhave appeared that this may be the last time it will be possible to give a\ndetailed description of the hallucinogens in a single volume. Within\nanother five to ten years each hallucinogen may well require its own\nmonograph.
