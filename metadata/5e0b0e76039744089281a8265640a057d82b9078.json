The RAR file naming convention is purposely to evade DMCA crawlers.\n\nThese torrents are an expression of appreciation to the NERDs for making all these wonderful ebooks available, providing missing and broken files as needed and giving me their blessing to redistribute them here.\n\nThese torrents are being posted anonymously via VPN for obvious reasons.  If these reasons aren't obvious to you, then you shouldn't be torrenting.\n\nInstead of complaining about the torrent, try rereading the above description.  Everything about these torrents is done for a reason, not without thought.\n\nEither you're familiar with NERDs ebooks and delighted at the opportunity to back fill your collection, or you're lucky enough to discover them now while they're still available, or you can whine and complain and miss the boat.  Your choice.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e0b0e76039744089281a8265640a057d82b9078","amp;dn":"New+ebook+packs+for+October+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e0b0e76039744089281a8265640a057d82b9078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,11,14,118,3,151,68,8,146,129,168,38,86,64,160,87,216,43,144,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
