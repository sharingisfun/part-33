In each episode of Deadly Dilemmas, they simply have to decide which course of action will leave them dead or alive. Featuring amazing clips, huge self-generated experiments and bizarre real-life case studies from around the world the series will attempt to answer questions including: if caught in a huge lightning strike, would taking cover in a metal caravan save you or kill you? And, if you had a fight with a crocodile or a great white shark, which do you chose for the highest chance of staying alive? Finally, you can only eat carrots or burgers for the rest of your life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which would be more likely to kill you?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c03ddbdf8174f72f52959dc52800e1614390bf5","amp;dn":"Deadly.Dilemmas.S01.720p.HDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c03ddbdf8174f72f52959dc52800e1614390bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,3,221,189,248,23,79,114,245,41,89,220,82,128,14,22,20,57,11,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
