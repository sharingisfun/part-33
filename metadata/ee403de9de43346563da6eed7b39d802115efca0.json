The terrible explosion that rips through the night sky and showers the hospital is not caused by a mortar, an artillery attack, or a bomb...\nIt is a lightning bolt, from my very first thunderstorm.\nAn anger from the sky which reassures me, and in some ways Im presses me\nmore than the fire of men... For I am ten days old, orphaned and content\nto feel that nature is stronger than man.\nOn this same day, D.1O, a nurse sets a package in the great white bed thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s between Amir and me. This bundle which is barely a few hours old is called Leyla Mirkovic.\nHere we are, the three of us together, for the first time.\nOur heads set against one another and our bodies taut like the branches of a star.\nI start to listen to the sounds of our lives.\nI am the oldest at ten days, the happy orphan that loves Leyla\nand loves Amir and loves the sound of an angry sky.\n\nThe Dormant Beast is first and foremost a book about memory - individual, coliective and developing memory. Set during the break-up of Yugoslavia, Enki BilalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birthpiace, these different memories mix the painted images of the past, present and future in strange combinations. its also about potential memory, which, although credibie enough, should be\navoided as much as possible. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about memory which could not have learned any meaningful lesson from this all too extraordinary twentieth century. \nNonetheless it contains a note of hope, dear to the author: his characters stiil have the need to love.\nA haunting and compeiling work by one of the foremost graphic novel artists in the world.&quot;\n\nRandom review: &quot;This haunting, open-ended story of a future society reeling from terrorist violence turns the stuff of ugly current events into extraordinary art. Nike Hatzfield was born in Yugoslavia (like Bilal himself), during the siege of Sarajevo. Nike has perfect recall and can remember everything that has happened to him since he was orphaned as a baby. Because of this talent he's become the target of The Obsurantis Order, a kind of pan-fundamentalist (Judaism, Christianity and Islam team up) terrorist group dedicated to eradicating &quot;thought, science, culture and memory.&quot; Nike is dragooned into a plot to destroy the OO by the Federal Bureau of International Investigation, an agency as ruthless as the fiendish terrorists it's fighting. A pawn of both sides, Nike is brutally transformed into a deadly telepathic homing device guided to the mysterious target by a voice in his head. But he's also determined to find two orphans who survived Sarajevo with him, who are also targets of the OO. The book moves cinematically between the lives of these three. Much as he did in his acclaimed graphic novel The Nikopol Trilogy, Bilal has created a beautiful, brooding retro-future world that looks like a cross between Blade Runner and Dune. It's a world of random violence, human isolation, flying cars, deadly androids and blighted high-tech multileveled cities rendered in gothic gloom and punctuated by streaks of rich startling color. Best known in Europe for award-winning comics that dwell on themes of violence, intolerance and uncertain identity, Bilal has used the grim events of contemporary life to create a gripping work of allegorical science fiction.&quot;\n\n\nMyself: &quot;Enki Bilal is not only one of the most brilliant visioneers in the European post-modern Science fiction scene. He also has the nerve to be outright political in his comics, making concrete testimonies and accusations under the cover of writing/drawing SF. This comic is a requiem for ex-Yugoslavia and besides from recounting impressions of the wartime as short textual flashbacks, the story (set in the future) is an obvious analogy to the atrocities that went down not so long ago. The protagonist, wanted by every organsation, be it clandestine or public, rebellious or governmental, for possesing an exact memory of the war, is constantly inquiered as to whether he is Moslem, Kroatain, Serbian, Bosnian or which combination of those...&quot;\n\nPS: Thanks for all the feedback. Makes it all worthwhile :)\n\nPPS: A visioneer is what you get when you cross a visionary and a pioneer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee403de9de43346563da6eed7b39d802115efca0","amp;dn":"Enki+Bilal+-+The+Dormant+Beast+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee403de9de43346563da6eed7b39d802115efca0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,64,61,233,222,67,52,101,99,218,110,237,123,57,216,2,17,94,252,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
