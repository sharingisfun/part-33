Chandor\nCast: Robert Redford\n.: Plot :.\nDeep into a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean, an unnamed man (Redford) wakes to find his 39-foot yacht taking on water after a collision with a shipping container left floating on the high seas. With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c488b32d9f0674bc6bcd22af22feff08d666eda3","amp;dn":"All.Is.Lost.2013.HDRip.XviD-AQOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c488b32d9f0674bc6bcd22af22feff08d666eda3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,136,179,45,159,6,116,188,107,205,34,175,34,254,255,8,214,102,237,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
