Each issue included programs in the BASIC computer language, which readers could type into their own home computer.\n\nReaders were introduced to technological innovations of the day, such as optical disc recording technology, which was new at the time.\n\nUnlike other magazines produced by CTW, Enter did not tie into one of the television series produced by the organization. Perhaps for this reason, the magazine lasted only a few years. Beginning in June 1985, some of its features were folded into 3-2-1 Contact magazine, which printed computer programs as part of an &quot;Enter section&quot; for a short while. This section was later re-named &quot;BASIC training.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d31f15eca1fbb7e58b886f208560ae3be460423","amp;dn":"Enter+100%25+%28All+17+Issues%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d31f15eca1fbb7e58b886f208560ae3be460423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,49,241,94,202,31,187,126,88,184,134,242,8,86,10,227,190,70,4,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
