They also invent entirely new economic systems, like the â€œNew Work,â€ a New Deal for the technological era. Barefoot bankers cross the nation, microinvesting in high-tech communal mini-startups like Perry and Lesterâ€™s. Together, they transform the country, and Andrea Fleeks, a journo-turned-blogger, is there to document it.\r\n\r\nThen it slides into collapse. The New Work bust puts the dot.combomb to shame. Perry and Lester build a network of interactive rides in abandoned Wal-Marts across the land. As their rides, which commemorate the New Workâ€™s glory days, gain in popularity, a rogue Disney executive grows jealous, and convinces the police that Perry and Lesterâ€™s 3D printers are being used to run off AK-47s.\r\n\r\nHordes of goths descend on the shantytown built by the New Workers, joining the cult. Lawsuits multiply as venture capitalists take on a new investment strategy: backing litigation against companies like Disney. Lester and Perryâ€™s friendship falls to pieces when Lester gets the â€˜fatkinsâ€™ treatment, turning him into a sybaritic gigolo.\r\n\r\nThen things get really interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Bernadette Dunne\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a947f9a6e9cf411928212b38214fc895119cc656","amp;dn":"Cory+Doctorow+-+Makers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a947f9a6e9cf411928212b38214fc895119cc656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,71,249,166,233,207,65,25,40,33,43,56,33,79,200,149,17,156,198,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
