What that convenient phrase hides is the sheer amount of originality and creativity that went into creating the music for games and demos on the Commodore 64. Composers were limited to three voices at once and often didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even see the game before having to compose the music! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty well documented that humans are at their best when overcoming limitations or under deadline, and the classic C64 composers pared music to its essence. They had their own sounds, and their own way of playing them. And since they were pioneers, the only experience they could bring was from a rich diversity of other musical genres: everything from Bluegrass to Funk to Electronica to Punk. \n\nIt was a short window of time when musicians ruled the roost, and people loved them for it. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never see it again.Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \n\nChris Abbott (www.c64audio.com)\ncredits\nreleased 20 February 2012\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bandcamp.robotelephant.co.uk/album/sid-chip-sounds-the-music-of-the-commodore-64&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bandcamp.robotelephant.co.uk/album/sid-chip-sounds-the-music-of-the-commodore-64&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:779e00b94eaed82769a27234a6cff609a2b89f58","amp;dn":"VA-SID_Chip_Sounds_The_Music_Of_The_Commodore_64-%28Proper%29-2012-S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"779e00b94eaed82769a27234a6cff609a2b89f58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,158,0,185,78,174,216,39,105,162,114,52,166,207,246,9,162,184,159,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
