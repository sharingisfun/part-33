Therefore I don't use any post-processing or any sound improver. What you get is a clear and flat transfer.\n For getting a clear sound I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing for each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to loose any musical information.\n Surface noises, as long they are not to high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded with extremly low level I do a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, 'Life is full of surface noises'.\n In some cases this means I have to do a compromise... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria which is IMO quite high.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81479290b2a2daf221f7ae9ce6d69c18600d93e6","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Dire+Straits+-+Love+Over+Gold+%281982%29+-+2010%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81479290b2a2daf221f7ae9ce6d69c18600d93e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,71,146,144,178,162,218,242,33,247,174,156,230,214,156,24,96,13,147,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
