Driven by prophetic visions, the three know that time is running short, know that they must find their elusive enemy before his darkness consumes them all.\n\nThis is the third in the Symphony of Ages series. Like the others, I've cleaned up the audio, chapterized the book, and updated all the tags. This series is, for me, a test to see how much the community likes this sort of thing. If it gets a strong positive response, I've got tons of other books I've done the same thing too I'd love to share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090704392e47c228eceae2723d9f2edc05ab8cf2","amp;dn":"Destiny%3A+Child+of+the+Sky+-+Elizabeth+Haydon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090704392e47c228eceae2723d9f2edc05ab8cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,7,4,57,46,71,194,40,236,234,226,114,61,159,46,220,5,171,140,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
