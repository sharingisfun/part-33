The only problem is that they would much rather not use their special abilities for good. Episodes of the new series are being released every other day on Cracked.com, with the fifth and final episode airing on Wednesday, August 13th, 2014.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬ËœWorkoholicsÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ meets Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeroesÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ comedy focuses on this powered group of coworkers going out of their way to not use their powers to fight crime, because fighting crime looks Ã¢â‚¬Å“just, like, way too hard, man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Writer Cody Johnston says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We saw Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe AvengersÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ and wondered why no one ever tried to take a little nap or just dick around on their phone to unwind, so we made this. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hoping Thor is introduced to the concept of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœvegging outÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Ã¢â‚¬ËœAvengers 2Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ, but in the meantime we hope you enjoy our fun, action-packed series that was made for more or less the same amount of money as all of MarvelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and future films.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:847d7ec5741dce617a742addde841dee9a627702","amp;dn":"Antiheroes+%281+-+5%29+Cracked+Web+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"847d7ec5741dce617a742addde841dee9a627702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,125,126,197,116,29,206,97,122,116,42,221,222,132,29,238,154,98,119,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
