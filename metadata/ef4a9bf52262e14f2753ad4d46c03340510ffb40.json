The microbiome is a whole inner world that lives within your intestinesÃ¢â‚¬â€trillions of tiny microbes that help you extract the nutrients from your food, balance your mood, and sharpen your clarity and focus.\n\nThese beneficial bacteria make up a separate ecology within the body and have an enormous influence on your metabolism, your hormones, your cravingsÃ¢â‚¬â€even your genes. The microbiome's health is intimately involved with yours: when it flourishes, you flourish. When it craves sugar, so do you. When it operates at peak efficiency, so does your metabolism. And when your microbiome is out of balance, you might find yourself gaining weight or unable to lose weight, no matter how much you exercise or how carefully you eat. To achieve your ideal weight, you need the help of your microbiome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef4a9bf52262e14f2753ad4d46c03340510ffb40","amp;dn":"The+Microbiome+Diet%3A+The+Scientifically+Proven+Way+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef4a9bf52262e14f2753ad4d46c03340510ffb40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,74,155,245,34,98,225,79,39,83,173,77,70,192,51,64,81,15,251,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
