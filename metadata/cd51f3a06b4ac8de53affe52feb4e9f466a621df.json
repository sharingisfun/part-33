En route, Tom meets family friend Casey (John Carradine), a former preacher who warns Tom that dust storms, crop failures, and new agricultural methods have financially decimated the once prosperous Oklahoma farmland. Upon returning to his family farm, Tom is greeted by his mother (Oscar-winner Jane Darwell), who tells him that the family is packing up for the &quot;promised land&quot; of California. Warned that they shouldn't expect a warm welcome in California--they've already seen the caravan of dispirited farmers, heading back home after striking out at finding work--the Joads push on all the same. Their first stop is a wretched migrant camp, full of starving children and surrounded by armed guards. Further down the road, the Joads drive into an idyllic government camp, with clean lodging, indoor plumbing, and a self-governing clientele. When Tom ultimately bids goodbye to his mother, who asks him where he'll go, he delivers the film's most famous speech: &quot;I'll be all around...Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat...Whenever there's a cop beating a guy, I'll be there...And when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build. I'll be there too.&quot; \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032551/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032551/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-32551/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-32551/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:03:49\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1489 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd51f3a06b4ac8de53affe52feb4e9f466a621df","amp;dn":"The+Grapes+of+Wrath+%281940%29+Henry+Fonda+Eng+%28multisubs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd51f3a06b4ac8de53affe52feb4e9f466a621df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,81,243,160,107,74,200,222,83,175,254,82,254,180,233,244,102,166,33,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
