If you want quality, get the 3D HDTV rip from LOL or DIMENSION. Someone asked for this specifically, so here it is!\n\nThe quality is poor, but this is exactly what NBC is streaming on their site. I captured this using Replay Media Catcher, which records the exact digital stream. It is not a screen capture, but a digital stream recording. For some reason, it looks better on NBC's site than it does in my favorite video player (Gom Player), so I suspect the flash player on the site is using extra filters to hide the blockiness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218b4e9c8cbe6fdae9cdbc1b3c88fa4f3a39e09d","amp;dn":"Chuck+S02E12+%283-D%29+from+NBC.com+%28FLV+format%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218b4e9c8cbe6fdae9cdbc1b3c88fa4f3a39e09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,139,78,156,140,190,111,218,233,205,188,27,60,136,250,79,58,57,224,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
