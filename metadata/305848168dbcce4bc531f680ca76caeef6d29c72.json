That your mind plays tricks on you, that you have a force within, that works against you? Have you ever felt a wish to control that power, how easy life would be. Let this book be your manual to a better life. When you ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ my theory, and start applying it, you will realise that you have reached the final understanding, a sort of Nirvana. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big words. But it will take you home, and make you land in a new security. You have before worked on the consequences of your brainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reactions, now you will go one step beyond that, to the source of why we behave like we do. And the facts are simple, and very easy to understand.\n\nPassword: review\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:305848168dbcce4bc531f680ca76caeef6d29c72","amp;dn":"Ride+Your+Inner+Dragon+%28E-book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"305848168dbcce4bc531f680ca76caeef6d29c72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,88,72,22,141,188,206,75,197,49,246,128,202,118,202,238,246,210,156,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
