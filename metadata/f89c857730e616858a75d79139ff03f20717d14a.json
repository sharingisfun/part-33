For the most part, it's just the man and his guitar, but really, no more is needed; between his solid feel for rhythm, his clear, expressive guitar work, and his more-than-serviceable vocals, Hooker doesn't need any help. He's a master of setting a mood, whether it's the intimacy of &quot;Stuttering Blues,&quot; the sweetness of &quot;Wobbling Baby,&quot; or the lamentation of &quot;My Baby Don't Love Me,&quot; and he's so subtle that most of the time you don't even notice him doing it. Okay, so &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; isn't on this album. Doesn't matter.\n\n- Genevieve Williams\n\nTracklisting:\n01 Stuttering Blues\n02 Pouring Down Rain\n03 You Lost a Good Man\n04 Love My Baby\n05 Misbelieving Baby\n06 Drifting Blues\n07 Wobbling Baby\n08 Goin' South\n09 Don't Turn Me From Your Door\n10 My Baby Don't Love Me\n11 I Ain't Got Nobody\n12 Real Real Gone\n13 Guitar Lovin' Man\n14 Talk About Your Baby\n15 Blue Monday\n16 My Baby Put Me Down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f89c857730e616858a75d79139ff03f20717d14a","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+Don%27t+Turn+Me+from+Your+Door%3A+John+Lee+Hooker+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f89c857730e616858a75d79139ff03f20717d14a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,156,133,119,48,230,22,133,138,117,215,145,57,255,3,242,7,23,209,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
