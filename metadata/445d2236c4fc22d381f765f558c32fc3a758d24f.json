In a role created specifically for the movie, Alec Baldwin appears as a sales motivator, informing the group of hard-luck salesmen that they must compete in a sales contest where the losers will be fired. The agents work their same tired leads, until one hatches a scheme to burglarize the office, steal the leads, and sell them to a rival. Featuring a cast that includes Al Pacino as the office's sales leader, Jack Lemmon as an elderly loser, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris as frustrated salesmen, Kevin Spacey as the harassed office manager, and Jonathan Pryce as a client, Glengarry Glen Ross is, at its core, a character study about a group of men whose time has passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin \r\nDIRECTOR......: James Foley\r\nWRITERS.......: David Mamet\r\nGENRE.........: Drama\r\nRATING........: 7.8/10  74,255 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 80\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 40mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.27 GiB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x820\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (3 Pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English DTS 5.1 768 Kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Director Commentary (10th Anniversary DVD)\r\nAUDIO3........: Director Commentary (Laserdisc)\r\nAUDIO4........: Jack Lemmon Commentary (Laserdisc)\r\nSOURCE........: Glengarry Glen Ross 1992 1080p Blu-ray AVC DTS-HD MA 5.1\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG  \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-05-05\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreens\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/31vi6q7ci/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:445d2236c4fc22d381f765f558c32fc3a758d24f","amp;dn":"Glengarry.Glen.Ross.1992.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"445d2236c4fc22d381f765f558c32fc3a758d24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,93,34,54,196,252,34,211,129,247,101,245,88,195,47,195,167,88,210,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
