After obtaining his license to practice law, David pursued advanced studies in international law and worked in Paris, France.\n\nJock Boucher series:\nIce Fire (#1): Cajun-born Jock Boucher has overcome modest beginnings to assume the prestigious position of U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In one of his first cases on the bench, he encounters a scientist who has been hiding in mortal fear for more than twenty years. The fugitive claims that another judge accepted bribes to help a powerful global energy company steal his intellectual property: a revolutionary discovery that could end AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dependence on foreign oil. Risking his career and his life, Boucher follows a trail of cryptic clues to the bottom of the ocean and soon finds himself the target of killersÃ¢â‚¬â€and too far from the law to ever return.\n\nBlood Game (#2): Having killed two men with his bare hands, federal judge Jock Boucher feels heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfit for his post on the bench. But when the president sends a fighter jet to whisk the renegade Cajun from a Mexican vacation to the White House to convince him otherwise, Boucher agrees to stay on. Trouble follows him, though, and on the night of his return to his home in the French Quarter, he is accosted by an armed street thug. Boucher defends himself. His attacker ends up dead.\n\nWith the body count rising around himÃ¢â‚¬â€despite all his best effortsÃ¢â‚¬â€Boucher and his friend Detective Fitch of the New Orleans Police Department discover that the would-be bandit has put them on the trail of an illegal arms ring. Weapons are being trafficked to foreign criminal insurgents whose violent rampage across northern Mexico is blocking the development of one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest energy fields, and powerful U.S. interests are determined to dislodge them by any means possible. Faced with the daunting possibility of hostilities with our neighbor to the south, Boucher must find a way to avert armed conflict on a scale he never imagined possible . . . while placing himself in mortal danger.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
