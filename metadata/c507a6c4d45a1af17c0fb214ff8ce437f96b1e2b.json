Smooth as a dry martini and equally intoxicating, Chamberland's third album DRIPING INDIGO cements her role as one of the best interpreters of classic songbook favorites. Two factors set Chamberland's music apart from the pack. First, the arrangements are slow and sexy relying on a small jazz ensemble for backing (piano, sax, bass, light rhythm). Secondly is her luscious voice, which caresses the listener with a breathy purr throughout the album. With a repertoire that features &quot;Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,&quot; Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot; and &quot; How Deep Is Your Love,&quot; the album slowly seduces with its corner jazz club ambience and torch singer grace. &quot;\n\nChantal Chamberland - Dripping Indigo Tracklist:\n01  Once in a While 3:38\n02  Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered 3:34\n03  I Wanna Be Around 4:12\n04  Georgia on My Mind 4:05\n05  One for My Baby 3:37\n06  How Deep Is Your Love 3:53\n07  I'm Beginning to See the Light 2:32\n08  Lover Man 4:38\n09  CinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mas-Bars 2:41\n10  Teach Me Tonight 3:21\n11  Body and Soul 4:04\n12  Someday 3:44\n13  Good Life 4:26\n14  I've Got You Under My Skin 4:35\n15  Hot Night in Baton Rouge 4:38\n16  Don't Get Around Much Anymore 2:31\n17  Smoke Gets in Your Eyes 4:31\n18  Hymne a l'Amour 3:30","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c507a6c4d45a1af17c0fb214ff8ce437f96b1e2b","amp;dn":"Chantal+Chamberland+-+Dripping+Indigo+%282005%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c507a6c4d45a1af17c0fb214ff8ce437f96b1e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,7,166,196,212,90,26,241,124,15,178,20,255,140,228,55,249,107,30,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
