Studios. Originally a limited series, it is written by Keith Giffen and J.M. DeMatteis and illustrated by Joe Abraham. The series follows the superhero Captain Valor as he adjusts to a new life in an alternate universe alongside Milo, a normal version of himself, and Milo's girlfriend Stephie, an alternate incarnation of Valor's arch-enemy Caliginous.\nPublication history\n\nIn 2004, the Hero Squared X-Tra Sized Special one shot was published by Atomeka Press, leading to a 2005 three-issue limited series by Boom!. As a result, in 2006 Hero Squared became an ongoing series which lasted for six issues. In January 2009, another 3-issue mini-series began, titled Hero Squared: Love and Death. These three issues are meant to wrap up the story left unfinished in the 2006 series.\n\nIn between the series, a two-issue limited series called Planetary Brigade featuring Captain Valor's superhero team was published. Another limited series, this one three issues, called Planetary Brigade: Origins, was also published.\n\n&quot;With HERO SQUARED Keith and I wanted to examine what would happen if you dropped a super hero into the real world,&quot; J.M. DeMatteis said (not that anyone asked him). &quot;No matter how much you layer super hero tales with psychology and philosophy, the story always comes down to two super beings solving problems by dropping buildings on each other's heads. In Captain Valor's parallel universe cities weren't destroyed beyond repair, innocent people didn't get hurt, and super heroes always came back to life.\n\nTorrent contains every book mentioned above. The v2 TPB is included as well, as it's higher resolution than the single issues (which have ads, letter pages, etc.), and only 62mb. skip it or the singles if you want. I also threw in a couple variant covers I found.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e7b30da08238de6a243574613b1f1789b3c9ab6","amp;dn":"Hero+Squared","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e7b30da08238de6a243574613b1f1789b3c9ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,123,48,218,8,35,141,230,162,67,87,70,19,177,241,120,155,60,154,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
