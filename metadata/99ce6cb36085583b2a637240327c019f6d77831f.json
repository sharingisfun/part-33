No more cars with non-rotating wheels, better textures and models for other's cars, greater view distance in the rear view, etc.\r\n- Fog effect and light beams support in the DirectX 6 (they were exclusive effects for the 3dfx Voodoo).\r\n- Portability. All system settings are loaded from the ini file. No more registry!\r\n- Compatibility. Most problems with modern Windows were fixed. New system settings were added.\r\n- Full support of multi-core processors. Original game could work correctly only on one core. This change dramatically improves performance of the nGlide and the dgVoodoo.\r\n- Alt+Tab support. You can safely minimize the game when nGlide or dgVoodoo renderer is used.\r\n- Built-in screenshoter. Just press Print Screen key, and a screenshot will be saved into the screenshots subdirectory in the JPG/PNG/BMP format.\r\n- Improved keyboard support in the menu. Now it is much more consistent. You can also use the Tab and Shift+Tab to switch between elements.\r\n- Optimizations. 10 times faster gameplay loading on modern systems. To skip loading animation just press any key.\r\n- Bugfixes. More than 200 changes at all!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99ce6cb36085583b2a637240327c019f6d77831f","amp;dn":"+Need+For+Speed+III+Modern+v1.4.0+%28HD+%2B+Widescreen+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99ce6cb36085583b2a637240327c019f6d77831f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,206,108,179,96,133,88,59,42,99,114,64,50,124,1,159,109,119,131,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
