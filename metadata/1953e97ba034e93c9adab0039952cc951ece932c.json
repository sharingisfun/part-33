His flair for catchy melodies, riffs, and hooks resulted in a number one pop and number five R&amp;B hit with &quot;The Happy Organ&quot; in 1959. Cortez had another double winner in 1962 with &quot;Rinky Dink,&quot; this one peaking at number nine R&amp;B and number ten pop. Before his instrumental success, Cortez recorded for Ember as David Clowney in 1956, and was in the Pearls from 1955 to 1957. He landed one other song on the R&amp;B Top 50, &quot;Someone Has Taken Your Place,&quot; in 1973 for All Platinum. His other songs were recorded for Clock and Chess. There has been no domestic reissue of Cortez's songs, but there are import anthologies available.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:j9ftxqt5ldse~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:j9ftxqt5ldse~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nPresented here are 25 songs recorded by Cortez, mostly or entirely, for Clock between 1958 and 1961 -- mostly or entirely because although each track is grouped into a &quot;New York 1958-1961&quot; discography, a couple of them are given the dates 1965 on the CD track listing; the three dated 1993 are presumably unreleased outtakes from the era (although they are not precisely identified as such). The real question is: do you need to hear anything else besides his number one hit (and this album's opener) &quot;The Happy Organ&quot;? For almost everyone, the answer is no. The other songs are average R&amp;B-based rockers, sometimes given a lift above similar generic instrumental fare from the era by Cortez'sorgan and some sharp guitar (much or all of which was probably played by Jimmy Spruill, who did the guitar solo on &quot;The Happy Organ&quot;). The majority is instrumental, with Cortez occasionally adding vocals that are either perfunctory, or that fall within the ordinary, early Black vocal group style (as on &quot;Love Me as I Love You&quot;). Otherwise, this is for instrumental rock fans only, although Cortez deserves credit for popularizing the organ as a rock instrument. The moody reading of &quot;Summertime&quot; isn't bad, and when he and the band get a little less restrained on &quot;Tootsie,&quot; it seems possible that he could have influenced the sound of 1960s soul-rockers who used the organ, like Booker T. &amp; the MG's. Cortez's low-charting, soundalike follow-up to &quot;The Happy Organ,&quot; &quot;The Whistling Organ,&quot; is included, but his only other big hit, &quot;Rinky Dink&quot; (1962), is not, as it was done for Chess.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0cfqxqqhldje&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0cfqxqqhldje&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Organs-Guitars-Piano-Shuffles/dp/B000007Y4I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Happy-Organs-Guitars-Piano-Shuffles/dp/B000007Y4I&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
