First he meets Amy, the easy-going yet enigmatgic girl with a motorcycle. Then, a 100-foot-tall robot appears out of nowhere, evidently drawn the mysterious cargo held within the trailer of the transport... But what is this robot and why is it attracted to the cargo? It's clear that Amy knows the answers, but will Darren survive long enough to find out the truth? The questions have only begun in TERRANOVA, a boy-meets-girl-meets-giant-robot adventure of &quot;epic&quot; proportions! \n\nGETTING THE TERRANOVA ONTO YOUR PSP:\n   1. Download the .CBR files\n   2. Uncompress the .CBR file with WinRar or any other compression software compatible with .CBR files.\n   3. Save the images you just uncompressed from the .CBR file to your PSP's Memory Stick Duo. If you have formatted the Memory Stick with a PSP the proper folders structure will be automatically created. If the Memory Stick has not been formatted, you will need to create a folder named &quot;PSP&quot; on the Memory Stick and then another called &quot;PHOTO&quot; within the &quot;PSP&quot; folder. The .CBR file will contain a folder title &quot;terranova - Issue X&quot; -- where &quot;X&quot; is replaced with the issue number you are putting there. Save this entire folder within the &quot;PHOTO&quot; folder or save the individual image files directly to the &quot;PHOTO&quot; folder. The PSP will not recognize sub-folders more than one level deep within the &quot;PHOTO&quot; folder. For example you cannot have &quot;PHOTO &gt; TERRANOVA&gt; TERRANOVA - PART1&quot;. However, you could do this &quot;PHOTO &gt;  TERRNOVA&quot;. Save the files to the Memory Stick using one of the following methods:\n      ? Using a commercially available USB cable\n      ? Using a PC with a Memory Stick slot\n      ? Using a commercially available Memory Stick USB reader/writer\n\nVIEWING TERRANOVA ON YOUR PSP:\n   1. Insert the Memory Stick Duo that contains the files for the issue of Terranova you wish to view.\n   2. From the PSP main menu, select the &quot;Photo&quot; icon using the X button.\n   3. If you saved the images to a sub-folder, scroll to that folder and select the folder using the X button.\n   4. Select the image you wish to view (we recommend starting at the beginning with 01.JPG) and press the X button.\n   5. Use the L and R &quot;shoulder&quot; buttons, scroll through the pages of Terranova.\n   6. Enjoy.\n\nVIEWING TERRANOVA ON YOUR PC\n   \n    1.
