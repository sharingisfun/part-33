It institutionalizes corruption and arbitrary force, most oppressive to the poorest and weakest people under its sway. Against this backdrop, in an unnamed city by the sea, four people struggle to survive. Dina, Maneck, and two tailors, the Untouchables Om and Ishvar, who are sewing in Dina's service, undergo a series of reversals, punctuated only by small mocking advances, that start them on a trajectory towards unhappiness and despair. Yet, in choosing what they will do, they exhibit a basic dignity and humanity that belies their mistreatment as part of the underclass. By merely surviving until their load becomes unbearable, and then living on past that point, they have accomplished something.\n\n\n\nFile format:  mp3  (64 Kbps, 24 KHz, 2 Channels, Joint Stereo)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de2197efb8271fb81040ff3fb352497ed635c38a","amp;dn":"Rohinton+Mistry+-+A+Fine+Balance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de2197efb8271fb81040ff3fb352497ed635c38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,33,151,239,184,39,31,184,16,64,255,63,179,82,73,126,214,53,195,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
