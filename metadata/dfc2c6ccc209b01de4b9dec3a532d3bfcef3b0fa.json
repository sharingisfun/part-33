That first line-up comprised Christy Moore, vocals, guitar and bodhran, Donal Lunny on bouzouki and synthesiser, Declan Sinnott on electric guitar, Eoghan O'Neill on bass, Brian Calnan on drums and percussion, Davy Spillane on pipes and low whistle and Keith Donald on various saxophones. The band attracted huge attention for its blending of musical influences - folk, Irish traditional, rock, funk and jazz - as well as its commentary in the songs sung by Christy Moore on issues of concern in the areas of human rights and political skulduggery.\n\nThe original lineup of Moving Hearts:\n\nMulti-instrumentalist          Donal Lunny \nsinger, guitarist, songwriter  Christy Moore \nGuitarist                      Declan Sinnott \npiper                          Davy Spillane  \nsaxophonist                    Keith Donald, \ndrummer                        Brian Calman \nbassist                        Eoghan O'Neill.\n\nthis is their 1981 record\n\ntracks:\n    1 Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian roulette\n    2 Irish ways and Irish laws\n    3 McBride's\n    4 Before the deluge \n    5 Landlord\n    6 Category\n    7 Faithful departed\n    8 Lake of shadows\n    9 No time for love ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc2c6ccc209b01de4b9dec3a532d3bfcef3b0fa","amp;dn":"Moving+Hearts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc2c6ccc209b01de4b9dec3a532d3bfcef3b0fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,194,198,204,194,9,176,29,228,185,222,195,165,50,211,191,206,243,176,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
