The last thing she needs is yet another forest ranger to stir up trouble for the ranchers. But when she meets single dad Scott Ennison and his daughter, she realizes there's something special about this ranger. Scott has vowed to protect the land and the ranchers his predecessors have alienated in the past. Yet no one wants to trust himÃ¢â‚¬â€except courageous Melanie. Together they'll prove that a rancher and a ranger can become neighbors, friendsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦maybe even a family.\n\n2 - The Forest Ranger's Husband\nA Father's Return: Standing before Fire Control Officer Matt Cutter is a five-year-old replica of himselfÃ¢â‚¬â€the son he never knew he had. All Matt wants to do is hug little Davie and make up for the lost years. But forest ranger Andie Foster, the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother whom Matt left behind, is understandably afraid. How can Matt possibly explain the lapse of faithÃ¢â‚¬â€in God and himselfÃ¢â‚¬â€that drove him away from what he loved most? And will the lovely forest ranger give him a second chance to be a husband and father forever?\n\n3 - The Forest Ranger's Child\nNowhere to go but home: Six months pregnant, abandoned and without a penny to her name, Lily Hansen has only one place to go. The ranching communityÃ¢â‚¬â€and her traditional fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take kindly to her situation. But when a handsome forest ranger saves Lily from a flash flood, all she sees is concern in his warm brown eyes. She soon discovers that Nate Coates's own harrowing family history is behind his need to take care of her. Though she dreams of marriage, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to open her heart to love before she can become NateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife.\n\n4 - Falling for the Forest Ranger\nA man who takes risks: Working for the Forest Service, Tanner Bohlman knows the dangers of IdahoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untamed lands and rivers. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly no place for a dainty woman like widowed mother Zoe Lawton, even if she is a capable marine biologist. But Zoe is new in town and could use a guide. When Tanner discovers her young son has never been fishing, he quickly becomes a father figure. Suddenly one sweet child, and a woman with more grit than he gave her credit for, are tugging on this manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartstrings. And before long, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s questioning his vow never to love again. \n\n5 - Healing the Forest Ranger\nRancher to the Rescue: When wild mustangs threaten someone's life, rancher Cade Baldwin springs into action. But he's not pleased when he sees the beautiful woman he's saved is the town's new forest ranger. Lyn Warner is determined to round up the wild horses he loves so much.

But Cade's strong faith and steady love might be exactly what they all need to create an unbreakable family.\n\n6 - The Forest Ranger's Return\nThe Soldier's Second Chance: After being injured in Afghanistan, former soldier Dal Savatch thought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d lost everything.

Can two wounded souls find healing and happiness in a future together?\n\n7 - The Forest Ranger's Christmas\nA Small-Town Christmas: Josie Rushton's in Camlin for the holidaysÃ¢â‚¬â€but not for long. She has just a few weeks to persuade her ailing grandfather to leave his small Nevada town and move closer to her Las Vegas home.
