This should be open to the world to have, so that others may be able to pick up where they left off and make their own kernels, and not just a few select people to have.  The author of the source code has given me permission to post it here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97766a62588c9ea69a5da13ebaf9c66ddc6a7d10","amp;dn":"Mac+OS+X+Leopard+GM+Final+9A581+Kernel+Patch+%28INTEL%2FAMD%2FNO-HPET%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97766a62588c9ea69a5da13ebaf9c66ddc6a7d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,118,106,98,88,140,158,166,154,93,161,62,186,249,198,109,220,106,125,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
