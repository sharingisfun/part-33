Why? The aliens all look like circus clowns, use weapons that look clown like, and all have painted on smiles. Only a few of the young people in the town realize the danger and of course no one believes them. Armed with an ice cream truck they try and rescue their friends.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6baf27b4d286245ee68da60570d04d72ade78598","amp;dn":"Killer+Klowns+From+Outerspace+1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6baf27b4d286245ee68da60570d04d72ade78598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,175,39,180,210,134,36,94,230,141,166,5,112,208,77,114,173,231,133,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
