Waugh\n\n\n# The Westbourne Press\n# Published: May 2013\n# 304 pages\n# ISBN: 9781908906205\n\n\nDo Gazans ever have fun? Is the Strip beautiful? And do TV reports actually reflect ordinary life inside the world's largest 'open-air prison'? From beautiful beaches to sealed borders, from a secret New Year's Eve party to a lingerie market staffed entirely by men, award-winning writer Louisa Waugh paints an intimate picture of Gaza, revealing the pleasures and pains, hopes and frustrations of Gazans going about their daily lives.\n\nMeet Me in Gaza is an evocative portrait of a Mediterranean land and its people, and a touching account of what it means to be Gazan.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nLouisa B. Waugh lived and worked in the Gaza Strip from December 2007 to April 2009.\n\nHer other works include Hearing Birds Fly: A Nomadic Year in Mongolia, which won the 2004 inaugural Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize, and Selling Olga: Stories of Human Trafficking and Resistance.\n\nAuthor location: Edinburgh, Scotland \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18107122-meet-me-in-gaza&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18107122-meet-me-in-gaza&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a10663eafebbcee521b1af0b2b6d7bf809ad45","amp;dn":"Louisa+B.+Waugh+-+Meet+Me+in+Gaza%3A+Uncommon+Stories+of+Life+Insi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a10663eafebbcee521b1af0b2b6d7bf809ad45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,161,6,99,234,254,187,206,229,33,177,175,11,43,109,123,248,9,173,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
