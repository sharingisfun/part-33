Some thinking of me from years ago of how black energy could be the basis of everything in the univere as we know it. Everything is bases on zero-point particles and everything we see in he physical world is based on swirling connections of intereacting zero-point based particles.\n\nIncluded are two borland c programs written for dos. One is a dynamic newtonian-based model, the other is a einsteinian photo snaphot of black energy.\nBoth can be run using dosbox.\n\nFor everyone to read and to find out if it is interesting and if it may include a part of the truth about everything in the universe as we know it is based on zero-point particles which are infinte in bending of space but have no length, width or height.\n\nIf anyone is interested please give me some comments about this. I do have more programs. One interesting program is written in qbasic showing the distance of electrons swirling an neutron-proton core of an atom.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cf17a7adf86e8f75533910d6f00542929abe401","amp;dn":"black+energy+as+the+basis+of+the+known+universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cf17a7adf86e8f75533910d6f00542929abe401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,241,122,122,223,134,232,247,85,51,145,13,111,0,84,41,41,171,228,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
