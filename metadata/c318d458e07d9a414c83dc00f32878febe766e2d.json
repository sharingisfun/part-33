Buyers include Hollywood \nstars, large corporations - like the Hilton and Marriot hotel chains - \nand even former US presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. George W \nBush is also said to be a stake holder.\n\nBut scientists believe the real prize is trapped in the Moon's rocks. It \ncontains large deposits of an extremely rare gas called Helium-3. Could \nHelium-3 be mined and used as a new source of almost inexhaustible, \nclean and pollution-free energy on Earth? Whoever succeeds in \ntransporting Helium-3 back to Earth could solve the world's energy crisis.\n\nOne of the biggest contenders is US space contractor Lockheed Martin, \nwhich is currently developing technologies that will enable future lunar \nresidents to exploit the lunar surface.\n\nIn particular, it is working on a process which will convert Moon dust \ninto oxygen and water. It may even be able to turn it into rocket fuel.\n\nRussian scientists are working on a similar project and plan to start a \nstrip-mine operation on the Moon by 2020.\n\nWho will win what has been dubbed the second Moon race? And should we be \nexploiting the Moon's valuable resources at all? ?\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Size: 746 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:48:41\nVideo Codec:XviD\nVideo Resolution: 672x384\nVIdeo Bitrate: 2091 kbit/s\nAudio Bitrate: 139 kbit/s\nAudio Codec:MPEG Layer -3 (AC3)\nSubtitles:(N/A)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1004498/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1004498/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c318d458e07d9a414c83dc00f32878febe766e2d","amp;dn":"MOON+FOR+SALE-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c318d458e07d9a414c83dc00f32878febe766e2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,24,212,88,224,125,154,65,76,131,220,0,243,40,120,254,190,118,110,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
