And then Peter J. Wallison, lawyer and commentator on the Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Alex also discusses the issues of the day and takes your calls.\n\nHour-1: News and rants\nHour-2: Eugene Volokh then open lines\nHour-3: Peter Schiff\nHour-4: Peter J. Wallison\n\n-----------------------------------\nDue to family obligations, a new job, and a need to focus on certain goals in my life I have decided to stop editing and uploading The Alex Jones Show.  It is time for others to step up and get this job done.  I still plan to upload The Jeff Rense Show and The Intelligence Report with Mark Koernke.  Those shows are a bit easier for me to do and fit my schedule better.\n\nI want to make it clear that I am not stopping because of any other reason than my life is too busy to maintain this level of activity.  Spring is almost here and I will be planting a garden and I'm starting a new job and I need to spend more time with my wife and children.  \n\nMy last Alex Jones Show to upload will be on Friday, February 6, 2009.  In order to help jumpstart someone into doing this I have put together a how-to and included it in this torrent.  Feel free to make your own process and do your own thing.  This is just what I do and what the last 8 months have taught me.\n\n-----------------------------------\nRSS feed for my torrent releases:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/5e25814e76fa65cbd08074cfc0553244&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/5e25814e76fa65cbd08074cfc0553244&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ceec43acb0d28cfef1d012edb0a28ba6e48bbb","amp;dn":"Alex.Jones.Show.2009.02.04-chakra71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ceec43acb0d28cfef1d012edb0a28ba6e48bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,206,236,67,172,176,210,140,254,241,208,18,237,176,162,139,166,228,139,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
