Whether it is connected to a painting, a decorative accessory or a T-shirt, this item is going to he more sought after and infinitely more expensive than things decorated with stenciling, blocking or iron-on transfers. It's no wonder then that crafters everywhere dream of finding a shortcut to well executed, beautifully integrated hand painting. The One StrokeÃ¢â€žÂ¢ Painting Method is such a shortcut - a new, quick and easy painting technique with FolkArtÃ‚Â® Acrylic Colors. You may have experienced this method already with one of Donna Dewberry's wonderful laminated painting guides which allow you to gain experience and practice over Donna's own strokes.
