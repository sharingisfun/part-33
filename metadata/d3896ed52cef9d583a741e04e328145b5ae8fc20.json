Brougher, Esq., MPH\n\n \n\n \n\nAt first glance, ownership of intellectual property seems straightforward: the control over an invention or idea. But with the recent explosion of new scientific discoveries poised to transform public health and healthcare systems, costly and lengthy patent disputes threaten both to undermine the attempts to develop new medical technologies and to keep potentially life-saving treatments from patients who need them.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Property and Health Technologies grounds readers in patent law and explores how scientific research and enterprise are evolving in response. Geared specifically to the medical disciplines, it differentiates among different forms of legal protection for inventors such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, explains their limitations, and argues for balance between competing forces of exclusivity and availability. Chapters delve into the major legal controversies concerning medical and biotechnologies (deleted &quot;in terms of pricing, markets, and especially the tension between innovation and access&quot;), including:\n\n \n\nThe patent-eligibility of genes\nThe patent-eligibility of medical process patents\nThe rights and roles of universities and inventors\nThe balancing of access, innovation, and profit in drug development\nThe tension between biologics, small-molecule drugs, and their generic counterparts\nInternational patent law and access to medicine in the developing world\n \n\nAs these issues continue to shape and define the debate, Intellectual Property and Health Technologies enables professionals and graduate students in public health, health policy, healthcare administration, and medicine to understand patent law and how it affects the development of medical technology and the delivery of medicine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9781461482017.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9781461482017.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3896ed52cef9d583a741e04e328145b5ae8fc20","amp;dn":"Intellectual+Property+and+Health+Technologies+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3896ed52cef9d583a741e04e328145b5ae8fc20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,137,110,213,44,239,157,88,58,116,30,4,227,40,20,91,90,232,252,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
