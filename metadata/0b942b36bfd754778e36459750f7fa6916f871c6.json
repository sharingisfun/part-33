In recent years the C64 has enjoyed a spectacular revival manifesting itself once again as a retrocomputing platform.\n\n[ Compatible with Windows 7 ]\n\nC64 Forever\n\nTo allow you to experience and relive the wonders of this unique computer, Cloanto, developers of Commodore/Amiga software since the 1980s, has introduced C64 Forever, a revolutionary C64 emulator, preservation and support package.
