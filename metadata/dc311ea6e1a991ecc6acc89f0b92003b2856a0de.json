Oh, and Dropsy can also talk to animals.\nDropsy is a non-traditional take on the classic point and click adventure formula starring the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perpetually carefree namesake clown as he explores a richly detailed world full of colorful characters and sinister secrets, doling out hugs along the way.
