IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Athena, one thing you need to know about me? I hate having to protect the human race, but my job as Seeker asks me to do just thatÃ¢â‚¬â€so that one day, I can earn a spot in heaven.\n\nMy father is the leader of the Phantoms, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m pretty sure that the archangels think of me as a flight risk, maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why they gave me the most gorgeous and annoying partner in all of Halceyon, Adonis.\n\nHis kisses give me strength, his presence soothes my soulÃ¢â‚¬â€but our love, is completely forbidden.\n\nThere is a war coming, and now that the Titans have been released, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been brought to my front door. One thing is for certainÃ¢â‚¬â€IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to have to make a choice, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure I have the strength to make the right one, not anymore. Not after meeting Seth, not after my best friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s betrayal, and not after I meet my father face to face and learn the truthÃ¢â‚¬â€I may be exactly like him.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c818577a689f3ed2c86ac01ba07010c0e0a896df","amp;dn":"Divine+Uprising+by+Rachel+van+Dyken+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c818577a689f3ed2c86ac01ba07010c0e0a896df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,24,87,122,104,159,62,210,200,106,192,27,160,112,16,192,224,168,150,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
