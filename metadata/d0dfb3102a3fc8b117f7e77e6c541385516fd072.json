These guys hurtle down narrow twisty roads, along bumpy, dusty tracks, through deep water and across solid ice at speeds exceeding 130 miles an hour. They&amp;#039;re supported by teams of dedicated engineers and mechanics, together with their straight-talking bosses and success-hungry sponsors. It&amp;#039;s a world of fragile egos, high emotions and constant human drama.\n\nWith unprecedented access, Engineering the World Rally gets under the skin of the Subaru WRC team and follows their every move as they engineer and prepare the cars for each event, test and shakedown, enjoy the highs and suffer the lows of each three-day rally. It is an emotional rollercoaster of action both behind-the-scenes and on the rally stage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0dfb3102a3fc8b117f7e77e6c541385516fd072","amp;dn":"Engineering.the.World.Rally.S01E04.Discovery.Channel.PDTV.x264-B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0dfb3102a3fc8b117f7e77e6c541385516fd072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,223,179,16,42,63,200,177,23,247,231,126,108,84,19,133,81,111,208,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
