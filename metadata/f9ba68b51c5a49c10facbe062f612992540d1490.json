In the 1950s, she was one of the most famous proponents of exotica music, and became an international success based on the merits of her wide-ranging voice, which ranges &quot;well over three octaves&quot;[2] and was commonly claimed to span four[3] and five[4]octaves at its peak.\n\nFor more: ht8p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yma_S%C3%BAmac\n\n\n01.
