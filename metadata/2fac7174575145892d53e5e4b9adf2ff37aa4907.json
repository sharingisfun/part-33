Since the demise of Brit-pop, most British bands have become decreasingly commercial, and while Warm Jets are no exception, they manage to combine the best of Brit-pop with the best of post-rock. The songs aren't overproduced and the sound is a bit lazy (think of a young, British Pavement), but the pop appeal is definitely present, especially in the stellar singles &quot;Hurricane,&quot; &quot;Autopia&quot; and the title track. There is only a minimal amount of filler, and the understated musicianship presented creates a truly unique sound for this debut LP. Future Signs is a very assured debut and the work of a band who is poised to create some very memorable music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fac7174575145892d53e5e4b9adf2ff37aa4907","amp;dn":"Warm+Jets+-+Future+Signs+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fac7174575145892d53e5e4b9adf2ff37aa4907","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,172,113,116,87,81,69,137,45,83,229,228,185,173,242,255,55,170,73,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
