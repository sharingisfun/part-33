A few more songs were played that night, but the TV broadcast is just the 10 tracks from She's So Unusual.\n\n\nI am uploading 2 versions of this.  One is the the raw source (M2TS format), direct from the DVR.  Suitable to make a DVD-R if anyone feels the urge. \nI am also uploading a compressed MP4 file (x264) for people who don't need/want the full quality version. \n\n\nStick around and seed, so people who stumble across this down the road still get a chance to see it!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a2ae08918bece50d4ef13df1ab0045f0833755","amp;dn":"Cyndi.Lauper.2013.12.09.Front.and.Center.720p.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a2ae08918bece50d4ef13df1ab0045f0833755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,162,174,8,145,139,236,229,13,78,241,61,241,171,0,69,240,131,55,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
