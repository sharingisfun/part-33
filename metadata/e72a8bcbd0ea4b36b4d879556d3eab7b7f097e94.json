He was born in Lagaharre village in the city of Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. In his early years, Ali used to do small on-sreet business so as to support himself as a means of livelihood. When he was 13, he joined Afran Qallo cultural group which was then oprerating unofficially to promote the Oromo music and culture. The first song that he sung on stage was called &quot;Birra dha Bari'e&quot; so that the people nicknamed him &quot;Ali Birra,&quot; meaning &quot;Ali the Spring&quot;. The Haile Selasie regime banned the group in 1965 and arrested some of its members. Ali escaped arrest and moved to Addis Ababa.\n\nWhile he was within the group, he could travel to all regions of the country and show his talent to his admirers. He also traveled to the Sudan repeatedly and sang with well known celebrities like Mohammed Wardi.
