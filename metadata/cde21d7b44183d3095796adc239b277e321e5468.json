This is an extremely literal translation that attempts to preserve the tense and word usage as found in the original Greek and Hebrew writings. The text was scanned from a reprint of the 1898 edition as published by Baker Book House, Grand Rapids Michigan. The book is still in print and may be ordered from Baker Book House. Obvious errors in spelling or inconsistent spellings of the same word were corrected in the computer edition of the text.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde21d7b44183d3095796adc239b277e321e5468","amp;dn":"Young%27s+Literal+Translation+%28YLT+Bible%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde21d7b44183d3095796adc239b277e321e5468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,226,29,123,68,24,61,48,149,121,106,220,35,155,39,126,50,30,84,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
