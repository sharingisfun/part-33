Closing in on\ntwo dec-ades on the job, he still hasn't broken his string of strong\nsinger-songwriter records, without ever wandering anywhere near the\nmainstream-pop spotlight. On Good Time, he doesn't push himself hard, sticking\nto the familiar themes of &quot;Small Town Southern Man,&quot; &quot;Country Boy&quot; and &quot;Laid\nBack 'N Low Key.&quot; When he gets hold of a honky-tonk ditty like &quot;Good Time,&quot; he\nlets it roll on past the five-minute mark just to prove he can. Sometimes he\ngoes overboard, as in &quot;I Still Like Bologna,&quot; where he gets sentimental over\ncold cuts on white bread as a refuge from the world of laptops and cell phones.\nBut his finest songs are always his romantic ballads, and the best one here also\nsounds like the one he wrote the quickest: &quot;1976,&quot; where he sings about meeting\nhis wife in the good old days when &quot;Jimmy Carter moved to D.C./A Georgia boy\njust like me&quot; and reflects, &quot;Wonder Woman sure looked fine/Bionic Man was still\nprime time.&quot;\n\nLow bitrate averages due to the fact that this album is for once not mastered\nfor sheer loudness; there's actually dynamic range, something quite rare in\ntoday's albums of the Loudness War era.\n\nDon't forget to support the artists! We did.\n\nGroup News\n----------\nWe're looking for:\n\n-Rippers With Unreleased Music, New Promo or Pre/Retails.\n-Peeps with albums 2003 and older for Internal VBR ripping and archiving.\n-Secure EU/AS HQs.\n\nIf you have any of the above, find us.\n\nGreets to all the groups who put out quality releases, our sites for hosting\nus and people who have helped along the way.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a34847fe5385db9aa288760b8cb1cf3aa355268c","amp;dn":"Alan_Jackson-Good_Time-2008-VAG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a34847fe5385db9aa288760b8cb1cf3aa355268c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,72,71,254,83,133,219,154,162,136,118,11,140,177,207,58,163,85,38,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
