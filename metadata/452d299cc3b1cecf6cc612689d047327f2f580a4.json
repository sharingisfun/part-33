Galaxies, nebulae, and other astronomical elements simply float across the screen in brilliant clarity, fueled by New Age music by Opus 27. The images are mostly from the Hubble Space Telescope, along with some unique mosaics from several sources. The bigger your screen, the better for &quot;plasma art&quot; that could serve as the background at a party or a valentine to any star freak. You can even view the program in high definition if you have the right media set-up. Sometimes the images float in front of a wallpaper of stars that causes a 3-D effect or looks kinda hokey, depending on your point of view. You can find out what you are looking at by activating subtitles or by clicking a menu button that goes to a page-by-page detail about the subject and how the image was rendered. With literally out-of-this-world colors and textures, the beauty of the heavens is glorious to behold. Produced the same year Congress debates the fate of the Hubble (2004), this program serves record of the extraordinary worlds that are seen only by this workhorse satellite. Lobbyists may have no better weapon to use than the Stargaze DVDs\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1093\nVideo Resolution: 720x416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 448kb/s\nAudio Channels: 5.1\nRunTime Per Part: 1hr\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 700MB\nRipped by Shrek\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:452d299cc3b1cecf6cc612689d047327f2f580a4","amp;dn":"StarGaze2+-+Hubbles+View+Of+The+Universe+DVDRip+XviD+ac3-6+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"452d299cc3b1cecf6cc612689d047327f2f580a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,45,41,156,195,177,206,207,108,198,18,104,157,4,115,39,242,245,128,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
