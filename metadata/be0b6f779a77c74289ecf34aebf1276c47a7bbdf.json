They stop in Kiev, Ukraine to visit Chris's brother, Paul (Sadowski), before heading on to Moscow, Russia where Chris intends to propose to his girlfriend Natalie. After a night on the town, the group decides, reluctantly, to go on an &quot;extreme tour&quot; of the abandoned atomgrad Prypiat which sits in the shadow of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, site of the infamous disaster. They are joined by backpacking couple Zoe (Berdal) and Michael (Phillips). The group is initially denied access to the city but their tour guide Uris (Diatchenko) leads them in through an unmanned, forested check point. They spend the day exploring the abandoned city, which had been home to Chernobyl workers and their families before they were forced to evacuate over night.\n \nAs the group goes to leave later that day, Uris finds the wires have been chewed through and spends the next few hours trying to radio for help to no avail. Once night falls, the group begins arguing and affixing blame. Noises are heard outside and Uris goes out with a flashlight and pistol along with Chris. Shots are heard and Paul runs out to investigate, only to return with Chris whose leg has been severely mauled, seemingly by stray dogs who begin to attack the van. The next morning, Paul, Michael, and Amanda decide to go out looking for Uri who, according to Chris, had been taken by &quot;them&quot;. They follow a trail of blood and personal affects to find Uris' body in an underground complex, decapitated and in pieces. They take his gun and geiger counter and barely escape a group of creatures they witness eating Uri's body. They return to the van, planning to hike the 18 kilometers to the nearest checkpoint but Chris cannot move his leg. Chris and Natalie stay behind while the others go to get help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0b6f779a77c74289ecf34aebf1276c47a7bbdf","amp;dn":"Chernobyl+_Diaries.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0b6f779a77c74289ecf34aebf1276c47a7bbdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,11,111,119,154,119,199,66,137,236,243,74,235,241,39,108,71,167,187,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
