Through the stories of the Yolngu of NE Arnhem Land, the film looks at the GovernmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ongoing policies of paternalism and assimilation, examines the real issues underlying Indigenous disadvantage, and opens dialogue on ways forward that respect Aboriginal culture and dignity.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ourgeneration.org.au/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ourgeneration.org.au/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa731d6fc64fce64a9b4a3a8fa5dead584df5bfd","amp;dn":"Our+Generation+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa731d6fc64fce64a9b4a3a8fa5dead584df5bfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,115,29,111,198,79,206,100,169,180,163,168,250,93,234,213,132,223,91,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
