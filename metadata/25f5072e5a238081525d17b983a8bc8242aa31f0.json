Carne del Toro (03:28)\n\nIt may be hard to imagine Fred Eaglesmith as anything but the grassroots troubadour heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s come to be revered as. But Dusty (a reunion with producer Scott Merritt who helmed EaglesmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakthrough mid-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s albums), immediately proves to be a radical departure, and a thoroughly welcome one. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that EaglesmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting style is altered at all; the material is still anchored by his dead-on portrayals of small-town isolation and the desperate behaviour that stems from it. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changed is that Eaglesmith seems to have given Merritt free reign with instrumentation and arrangements, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s telling that Merritt receives equal billing on the cover. While waves of keyboards, strings and subtle sampling will probably turn off much of EaglesmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s die-hard following used to hearing him with his rough-edged live band, what is most impressive about Dusty is EaglesmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willingness to put aside the relative safety of that sound for one that aims for classic Memphis blue-eyed soul. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly achieve this goal. Instead the album could be the equivalent of Bruce SpringsteenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nebraska if it had been recorded with ProTools. The title track and &quot;I-75Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ most evoke this stark impression, but others, like &quot;Rainbow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ resemble lost Lambchop experiments. In general though, Dusty sounds and feels like it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t achieve EaglesmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original intention. But in the process, he and Merritt created something entirely different, and like a newborn colt, beautiful in its own awkward way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f5072e5a238081525d17b983a8bc8242aa31f0","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith+-+Dusty+%5B2004%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f5072e5a238081525d17b983a8bc8242aa31f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,245,7,46,90,35,128,129,82,93,23,185,131,168,188,130,66,170,49,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
