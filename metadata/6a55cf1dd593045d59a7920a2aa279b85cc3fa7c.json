The focus is on the conditions and consequences of EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pathbreaking achievements that sealed the decline of the classical notions of space, time, radiation, and matter, and resulted in the theory of relativity.  Particular attention is paid to the implications of conceptual conflicts for scientific views of the world at large, thus providing the basis for a comparison of the demise of the mechanical worldview at the turn of the 20th century with the challenges presented by cosmology at the turn of the 21st century. Throughout the work, EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contributions are not seen in isolation but instead set into the wider intellectual context of dealing with the problem of gravitation in the twilight of classical physics; the investigation of the historical development is carried out with a number of epistemological questions in mind, concerning, in particular, the transformation process of knowledge associated with the changing worldviews of physics. \n\n\n# Hardcover: 363 pages\n# Publisher: Birkhauser; 1st Edition. edition (2 Dec 2011)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 0817649395\n# ISBN-13: 978-0817649395","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a55cf1dd593045d59a7920a2aa279b85cc3fa7c","amp;dn":"Einstein+and+the+Changing+Worldviews+of+Physics+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a55cf1dd593045d59a7920a2aa279b85cc3fa7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,85,207,29,213,147,4,93,89,167,146,10,42,162,121,184,92,195,250,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
