I had these videos for some time and decided to upload them do to the lack of quality JKD videos available on the net. If I get more in the future, I will upload them. But, in any way, you can get an idea of what this training entails and, if you like them, subscribe yourself.\n\n\n\nContents:\n\n1. Lesson 1 - On Guard\n\n2. Lesson 2 - The Push Shuffle\n\n3. Lesson 3 - An Introduction to the Front Hand\n\n4. Lesson 4 - Breaking Down the Front Hand Lead\n\n5. Lesson 5 - Throwing the Front Hand Lead\n\n6. Lesson 6 - Applications with the Front Hand Lead\n\n7. Lesson 7 - When Should You Fight_(part one)\n\n8. Lesson 8 - When Should You Fight_(part two)\n\n9. Lesson 9 - Changing Up, Changing Down\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Use vlc player to view the videos.\n\n2. For anyone familiar with JKD, you should know what the abbreviation TC represents (the vagueness is for a reason) in JKD regarding Ted Wong, who represents JKD as taught by Bruce Lee at the time of his death, adherents. AND Ted Wong is not in the videos.\n\nSource for note 2 regarding Ted Wong representing Bruce Lee's art at the time of his death:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.totallyjkd.com/tw_articles_KINEinterview1.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.totallyjkd.com/tw_articles_KINEinterview1.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n3. In my opinion, some of the videos are superflous (to fill space to make more money) becuase JKD only has about &quot;7 hand techniques, 7 kicking techniques and 7 footworks plus one single On-guard stance&quot; or according to Teri Tom, &quot;4 or five punches, 3 or 4 kicks, and a few grppling techniques.&quot;\n\n\nSources for note number 3: \n\n1.
