Within weeks, society has collapsed entirely. Small groups of human beings survive, holed-up in schools, hospitals, and shopping malls, desperately fighting to stay alive. Only a few things are known about these &quot;Zombies&quot;: They desperately crave the flesh and brains of the living. They may only be killed by destroying their brains, via a bullet, incineration, or other extreme trauma. They possess only a rudimentary intelligence, and seem to operate on instinct and very dim memories of their prior life. Any person who dies will become a zombie within hours of their death. Those bitten by a zombie will become ill and eventually become zombies as well. 42 cartoonists from around the world have come together in 144 pages of raw, black &amp; white comix, to describe this terrific sequence of events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a94874e239f4bae307b34105a766c752e1a4b8eb","amp;dn":"Bogus+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a94874e239f4bae307b34105a766c752e1a4b8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,72,116,226,57,244,186,227,7,179,65,5,167,102,199,82,225,164,184,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
