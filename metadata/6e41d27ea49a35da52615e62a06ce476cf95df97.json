Their surroundings appear as Earth did 200 years ago but the planet has two suns so they're fairly certain they didn't somehow end up back home. People however seem to be frozen in time. They eventually stumble upon Jeremy Wickwire, who is the caretaker for the locale. His explanation of what he is and where they are defies belief but in the end, he does grant them their wish.\n\n\nAnother fav. of mine.\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e41d27ea49a35da52615e62a06ce476cf95df97","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Elegy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e41d27ea49a35da52615e62a06ce476cf95df97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,65,210,126,164,154,53,218,82,97,94,98,160,108,228,118,207,149,223,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
