Binaural Recording transcends normally recorded stereo, since it accurately reproduces the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in the sound waves. Binaural recordings can very convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead, above, or wherever else the sound actually came from during recording.\n\nAire Freshener is a combined nature sounds player, CD player, and MIDI wind chimes player.\nYou can download Aire Freshener v2.0 Portable @ http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6484412\n\n\nInstall: Extract the files to the Plugins directory from Aire Freshener\nPlugin your Headphones, start Aire Freshener and select one of the Environments\n\nBinaural Nature Environments:\n\n- Crickets at Night\n- Forest Ambience\n- Forest Stream\n- Frog Chorus\n- Lonesome Beach\n- Night Ambience\n- Rainforest\n- Relaxing Rain\n- Spring Peepers\n- Thunderstorm\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ecc72fe48f34fc957b77fb26a0bfaf24dff616","amp;dn":"Binaural+Nature+Environments+for+Aire+Freshener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ecc72fe48f34fc957b77fb26a0bfaf24dff616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,236,199,47,228,143,52,252,149,123,119,251,38,160,191,175,36,223,246,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
