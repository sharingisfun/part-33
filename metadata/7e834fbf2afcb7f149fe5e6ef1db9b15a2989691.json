It was Browne's last top ten song, and his highest-charting as well, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in 1982. &quot;Somebody's Baby&quot; was not released on any of Browne's albums proper, but on the soundtrack to the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The film also featured the song at several key moments, mostly concerning the Jennifer Jason Leigh character's misadventures with sex.\n\n &quot;Somebody's Baby&quot; eventually made its way onto the Jackson Browne best-of compilation The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne, and also appeared on The Very Best of Jackson Browne. Browne's fatherless youth is thought to be referenced in this song.\n\nThe song was covered by Phantom Planet in 2001 for the Not Another Teen Movie soundtrack, which parodied 1980s teen movies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This song was also covered by Andru Donalds in 1997 for the Good Will Hunting soundtrack.\n\n                       \n\n                            ***Somebody's Baby.***\n\n\n                (The Quality Is Not That Good..So...Ha Ha..)\n                                \n                                   \n\n                                     Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e834fbf2afcb7f149fe5e6ef1db9b15a2989691","amp;dn":"Jackson+Browne-Somebody%5C%27s+Baby.%2880%5C%27s%29-Wushan.VOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e834fbf2afcb7f149fe5e6ef1db9b15a2989691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,131,79,191,42,252,183,241,73,254,94,110,241,219,155,21,162,152,150,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
