Nathan has a wife, but canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to be in love; only his young daughter Zoe makes coming home worthwhile. MirandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest concern is whether her new VW Bug is big enough to carry her sister and their boyfriends on a weekend escape from college finals. \n\nWhen reports of a widespread deadly Ã¢â‚¬Å“outbreakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ begin to surface, these ordinary people face extraordinary circumstances and suddenly their fates are intertwined. Recognizing they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t outrun the danger, Scarlet, Nathan, and Miranda desperately seek shelter at the same secluded ranch, Red Hill. Emotions run high while old and new relation-ships are tested in the face of a terrifying enemyÃ¢â‚¬â€ an enemy who no longer remembers what itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like to be human. \n\nSet against the backdrop of a brilliantly realized apocalyptic world, love somehow finds a way to survive. But what happens when the one youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d die for becomes the one who could destroy you? \n\nRed Hill grabs you from the first page and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go until its stunning conclusion. This is #1 New York Times bestselling author Jamie McGuire at her unforgettable best.\n\nAll books I upload are Full Retail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78d4055610747a10e4a3482dfc9f4ee41986d58e","amp;dn":"Red+Hill+-+Jamie+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78d4055610747a10e4a3482dfc9f4ee41986d58e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,212,5,86,16,116,122,16,228,163,72,45,252,159,78,228,25,134,213,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
