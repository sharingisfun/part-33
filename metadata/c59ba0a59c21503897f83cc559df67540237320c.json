Segal plays a glib fast-food tycoon and Bisset is his ex-wife, a pastry chef who may become the last course in an enigmatic killerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s banquet of death. Morley has a tasty field day as an acerbic gourmet magazine publisher whose cascading series of chins and stomachs bear witness to his love of fine dining. But the mogulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doctors have ordered him to give up his favorite dishes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and one by one the chefs who create those dishes are slain in the manner of their specialties. Phillipe Noiret, Jean-Pierre Cassel and Jean Rochefort give delicious support, as does a mouth-watering array of wild mushrooms, plump pigeons, shiny artichokes, rich chocolate and more gastronimical delights.
