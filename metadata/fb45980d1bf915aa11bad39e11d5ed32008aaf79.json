But, I don't think we can rate &quot;re-mixes&quot; as an alternate song? For the collectors there's nothing on this CD that hasn't been released before, but it is a nice compilation CD, for we have all the &quot;Christmas&quot; alternate takes (that has been released on other Import and BMG releases) on one CD. \n \nThanks to Isabelle!!\n\nMerry Christmas!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb45980d1bf915aa11bad39e11d5ed32008aaf79","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+O+come+all+ye+faithfull+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb45980d1bf915aa11bad39e11d5ed32008aaf79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,69,152,13,27,249,21,170,17,186,211,158,17,213,237,50,0,138,175,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
