Older than their peers and possessing utterly no fashion sense, Tiger relied on traditional indie-rock values, cribbing their sound from late-'80s alternative rock groups like the Pixies and the Wedding Present, while lacing it with droning chords borrowed from Stereolab and strong British melodies. We Are Puppets, the group's debut album, runs out of steam toward the end of the record, but its first two-thirds are invigorating indie-pop, filled with jagged, fuzzy guitars, call-and-response vocals, angular hooks and oddly ingratiating flat vocals. The best songs -- including the roaring singles &quot;Race&quot; and &quot;My Puppet Pal&quot; -- bristle with unconventional hooks and pounding rhythms. Tiger likes to make noise and their glee is infectious, even when the noise outweighs the melody. (4.5/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77ee9688334d76445062191359fe653e23597b4f","amp;dn":"Tiger+-+We+Are+Puppets+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77ee9688334d76445062191359fe653e23597b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,238,150,136,51,77,118,68,80,98,25,19,89,254,101,62,35,89,123,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
