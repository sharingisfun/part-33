Whether a track contains a lush, ambient-interlude feel or a sweeping explosion of chords, emotion runs high on this disc.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jennifer Marston, XLR8R\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s layering of conventional instruments like the guitar, drums, and bass with electronic enhancements, made for an album that has a temporal pitch embossed in supernatural hues. The dewy synth-flaked hazes have a classic ambient touch with chord bolts that streak through them etching a gorgeous penmanship. It is one of those albums that if you knew how to make, you would. The American DollarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s balance of earthy and airy tones is attractive. The duo do not lean more on one side than the other, which makes the graphic images permeating from their songs resound with a human voicing while piped in idealistic esthetics.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Susan Frances, Absolute Punk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac97e65ab019277373ecb1fee5d5ad9121fe8ec","amp;dn":"The+American+Dollar+-Atlas%28320+kbps%292010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac97e65ab019277373ecb1fee5d5ad9121fe8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,201,126,101,171,1,146,119,55,62,203,31,238,93,90,217,18,31,232,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
