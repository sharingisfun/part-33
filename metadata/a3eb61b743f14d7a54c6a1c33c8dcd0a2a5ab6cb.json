And since I love listening to them since 1987 it's not something that is going away soon. As matter of fact I saw them live twice, once with DRI and once with Death Angel.\n\nThese guys make very technical metal. But where a lot of technical metal bands but with great artistical value, fascinating lyrics and amazing musicians and fantastic compositions.\n\nAllas they never got a wide audience, probably since they we're too complex. They just never fitted in any category nor did they sound like any other band.\n\nThe music industry that just got attention for metal ignored them completely and promoted all the less experimental bands.\n\nDo pay them a visit http://www.holyterrorspeedmetal.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3eb61b743f14d7a54c6a1c33c8dcd0a2a5ab6cb","amp;dn":"Holy+Terror+Discography+albums+flac+rest+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3eb61b743f14d7a54c6a1c33c8dcd0a2a5ab6cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,235,97,183,67,241,77,122,84,198,161,195,60,141,205,10,42,90,182,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
