Although not pushing established boundaries, his rich, velvety voice and mature spoken-sung vocals convey a sense of truth and add depth to these introspective compositions. A bit of early Tom Waits creeps into his leathery vocals on a jaunty cover of Dave Carter's &quot;Crocodile Man,&quot; but Smither is best defined by the fingerpicked folk-blues. Bonnie Raitt, a fan from way back, contributes harmony vocals and slide guitar to his gentle eight-minute version of Dylan's &quot;Desolation Row.&quot; Some tunes are percussion-free, providing the singer's honey growl of a voice and clean acoustic guitar the most space to maneuver. Smither is loosest lamenting about his stolen car and its psychological effects on &quot;Let It Go,&quot; a track that, with his muttering and grouching, seems to have been recorded in an impromptu moment. A gentle cover of Mississippi John Hurt's &quot;Candy Man&quot; -- the album's only unaccompanied performance -- shows Smither's rather evident roots, and his closing waltz-styled version of Buffalo Springfield's &quot;Kind Woman&quot; reveals less obvious ones. Accompaniment by right-hand man David &quot;Goody&quot; Goodrich, who plays keyboards, guitars, and even something called a pinewood diddley bo, subtly enhances nearly every track on this quiet gem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9db8f91cde79b89ce5cb330c3727dce655fc26c","amp;dn":"Chris+Smither+-+Train+Home+%5B2003%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9db8f91cde79b89ce5cb330c3727dce655fc26c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,219,143,145,205,231,155,137,206,92,179,48,195,114,125,206,101,95,194,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
