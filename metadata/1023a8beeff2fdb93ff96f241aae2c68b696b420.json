And if that means paying notorious gunslinger Drake Frazier to take his place in a fight, sheâ€™ll barter her last gold nugget.\r\n\r\nBut Hope soon discovers sheâ€™ll have to give the handsome rattlesnake more than riches if she wants his help. His improper demands infuriate her; even as she luxuriates in the tantalizing heat of his embrace. But she refuses to yield to her desires. Sheâ€™ll accept his terms, then find a way to escape him... somehow...\r\n\r\n\r\nMURPHY'S LAW\r\n\r\nMurphyâ€™s Law reigns supreme. . .\r\n\r\nWhat else can explain how Murphy McKenna managed to get herself stuck in an unexpected, early-in-the-season Maine blizzard? In a very remote cabin. With dead phones. And impassable roads. Could there be a worse time for a desperate, badly wounded man to show up on her doorstep?\r\n\r\nInstinct demands Murphy not trust Garrett Thayer. After all, the man refuses to give her a straight answer about anything. Even her precious Himalayan cat, Moonshine, is suspicious. Who wouldnâ€™t be? Not only is Garrett hurt, heâ€™s also apparently been out wandering in the storm with nothing more than a duffel bag stuffed with money, antique jewelry (a bottle of antihistamines?) -- and a gun.\r\n\r\nWill Murphyâ€™s conscience allow her to turn her back on the handsome stranger who may be a thief, a bank robber, or worse . . .?\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECT STRANGERS\r\n\r\nIn 16th century England, Gabrielle Carelton is one of Queen Elizabethâ€™s most devoted ladies-in-waiting. Then that loyalty is put to the test when Her Majesty commands her to marry Scotsman Collin Douglas.\r\n\r\nBut when Gabrielle is kidnapped by Collinâ€™s twin brother, not even Good Queen Bess can save her.\r\n\r\nDubbed the Black Douglas, devilishly handsome Connor is known throughout the land for his magnificent feats of strength and cunning. But now he is in need of an heir. An English bride will bring peace to the warring nationsâ€”and give him the son he craves.\r\n\r\nWhat the Black Douglas doesnâ€™t expect is an Englishwoman as passionate as she is proud... and in possession of a desire that knows no boundaries.\r\n\r\nSet against the pageantry and savage splendor of 16th-century England and Scotland, here is the story of a man and a woman who begin as enemies and strangersâ€”and find a love that will triumph against all odds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1023a8beeff2fdb93ff96f241aae2c68b696b420","amp;dn":"Rebecca+Sinclair+ebooks+Highlander+Romance+epub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1023a8beeff2fdb93ff96f241aae2c68b696b420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,35,168,190,239,242,253,185,63,249,111,36,26,174,44,104,182,150,180,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
