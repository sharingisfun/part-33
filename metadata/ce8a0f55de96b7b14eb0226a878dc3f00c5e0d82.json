They were famous for wearing &quot;space suit&quot; costumes on stage, and for their innovative electronic guitar sound. They have since released 42 albums, selling more than 18 million records, and still tour.\nThe Spotnicks originated from Bo Starander and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Thelin's duo &quot;The Rebels&quot; (1956), who later became &quot;Rock-Teddy and The Blue Caps&quot;, a group formed in 1957 in Gothenburg now with guitarist Bo Winberg (born 27 March 1939) in the band as well as Bo Starander (born 11 March 1942) (rhythm guitar), and BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Thelin (born 27 June 1942) (bass guitar). In 1958 they added Ove Johansson (drums), changed their name to &quot;The Frazers&quot;, and began playing regularly in local clubs. They signed a recording contract in 1961, and changed their name\nto &quot;The Spotnicks&quot;, a play on the Russian satellite Sputnik as suggested by their manager, Roland Ferneborg. Starander was later known as Bob Lander.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spotnicks&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spotnicks.net/uk/index_uk.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is one of 3 CDs in the 2009 release &quot;3 Original Album Classics&quot;:\nThe Spotnicks (at home) in Gothenburg,\nThe Spotnicks in Tokyo and\nThe Spotnicks in Winterland\n\nThe Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo\noriginal album 1966\nCD produced 1991\n\n01  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Autumn In Japan\n02  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Memory Of Summer\n03  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Look Up To The Evening Star\n04  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Drum Diddley\n05  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - The Old Love Letters\n06  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Piercing The Unknown\n07  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Playboy's Bunny Hop\n08  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Crying In A Storm\n09  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - From Russia With Love\n10  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Happy Silence\n11  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Ode To Dawn\n12  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - The Lonesome Port\n13  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Husky\n14  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Sentimental Guitar (Vostok 6)\n15  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Recado\n16  The Spotnicks - The Spotnicks in Tokyo - Mood Of Asia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce8a0f55de96b7b14eb0226a878dc3f00c5e0d82","amp;dn":"Spotnicks+-+The+Spotnicks+in+Tokyo+%281966%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce8a0f55de96b7b14eb0226a878dc3f00c5e0d82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,138,15,85,222,150,183,177,78,176,34,106,135,141,195,240,12,94,13,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
