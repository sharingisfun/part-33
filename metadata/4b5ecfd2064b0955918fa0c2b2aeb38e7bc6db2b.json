Breaking Orbit\n2. No Running By The Pool\n3. MTL\n\n\nIDUNA is a four piece alternative rock group based out of Toronto, Ontario.\n\nPicking up on the sensibilities of Matt Good, Smashing Pumpkins, and other serious rock acts of the past three decades, their music ranges from heavy and soulful to high energy rock and roll exploring a wide range of melodic flourishes and dynamic flux.\n\nLyrically introspective, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music explores themes of youth, passion, and the aspirations that propel our lives. Relatable and concise without sacrificing their values, Iduna are a band about creativity and companionship.\n\n\nLinks:\n\nIdunamusic.com\n\nidunamusic.tumblr.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverbnation.com/Iduna","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b5ecfd2064b0955918fa0c2b2aeb38e7bc6db2b","amp;dn":"Iduna+-+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b5ecfd2064b0955918fa0c2b2aeb38e7bc6db2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,94,207,210,6,75,9,85,145,143,160,194,178,174,179,142,123,198,219,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
