Ramalingam et al. (Wiley-Scrivener, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book compiles all aspects of biomimetics from fundamental principles to current technological advances and their future trends in the development of nanoscale biomaterials and tissue engineering. The scope of this book is principally confined to biologically-inspired design of materials and systems for the development of next generation nanobiomaterials and tissue engineering. The book addresses the state-of-the-art of research progress in the applications of the principles, processes, and techniques of biomimetics. The prospective outcomes of current advancements and challenges in biomimetic approaches are also presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33838e381c2835c932beb4369ce5d15674349f46","amp;dn":"Biomimetics+-+Advancing+Nanobiomaterials+and+Tissue+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33838e381c2835c932beb4369ce5d15674349f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,131,142,56,28,40,53,201,50,190,180,54,156,229,209,86,116,52,159,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
