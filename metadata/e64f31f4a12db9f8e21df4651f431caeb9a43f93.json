Logan's Run won bij de Oscaruitreiking van 1977 een Special Achievement Award en werd genomineerd voor de Oscar voor beste camerawerk en die voor beste artdirection. Tevens won de film Golden Scrolls (de huidige Saturn Awards) voor beste sciencefictionfilm, beste camerawerk, beste artdirection, beste kostuums, beste decors en beste grime.\nLogan's Run is a 1976 American science fiction film directed by Michael Anderson and starring Michael York, Jenny Agutter, Richard Jordan, Roscoe Lee Browne, Farrah Fawcett, and Peter Ustinov. The screenplay by David Zelag Goodman was based on the novel of the same name by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson. It depicts a dystopian future society in which population and the consumption of resources are managed and maintained in equilibrium by the simple expedient of killing everyone who reaches the age of thirty, preventing overpopulation. The story follows the actions of Logan 5, a &quot;Sandman&quot;, as he runs from society's lethal demand.\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards and won a Special Academy Award for its visual effects, and won six Saturn Awards including Best Science Fiction Film.\nThe film was shot primarily in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including locations such as the Fort Worth Water Gardens and the Dallas Market CenterÃ¢â‚¬â€œ between June and September 1975. The film only uses the basic premise from the novel, that everyone must die at a specific age and Logan runs with Jessica as his companion while being chased by Francis. The motivations of the characters are quite different in the film. It was the first film to use Dolby Stereo on 70mm prints.\nIn 1977, a short-lived TV series based on the film aired, though only 14 episodes were produced. Since 1994, there have been several unsuccessful efforts to remake Logan's Run.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64f31f4a12db9f8e21df4651f431caeb9a43f93","amp;dn":"Logan%27s.Run.1976.Dvd5.NLsub.Optional","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64f31f4a12db9f8e21df4651f431caeb9a43f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,79,49,244,161,45,185,248,226,29,244,101,31,67,28,174,185,164,63,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
