Born and raised in New York, Bibb has traveled the planet extensively. He describes the people of this earth at length here, conjuring their conflicts and hardships, as well as their compassion, tolerance and empathy. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jericho RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was produced by Glen Scott, a young Englishman originally from Jamaica endowed with outstanding talent and creativity. ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lavish musical arrangements and attention to sound make this new recording an exceptionally fine production. Eric gives a whole new meaning to the blues of the 21st Century, proving that the genre remains as lively and relevant as ever. Jericho Road is an event in itself, and a superlative album.\n\n\n\n\n00 Eric Bibb album art.JPG\t                                    53.07 KB  \t\t01 Drinkin' Gourd.flac 44.1kHz 756 kbps\t                            16.63 MB\n02 Freedom Train.flac 44.1kHz  923 kbps\t                            22.80 MB\n03 Let The Mothers Step Up.flac 44.1kHz 787 kbps\t            19.99 MB\n04 Have A Heart.flac 44.1kHz 914 kbps\t                            29.52 MB\n05 The Right Thing.flac 44.1kHz 888 kbps\t                    26.64 MB\n06 Death Row Blues.flac 44.1kHz 793 kbps\t                    21.39 MB\n07 Can't Please Everybody.flac 44.1kHz 941 kbps\t                    31.01 MB\n08 The Lord's Work.flac 44.1kHz 714 kbps\t                    18.02 MB\n09 With My Maker I Am One.flac 44.1kHz 883 kbps\t                    29.30 MB\n10 They Know.flac 44.1kHz 724 kbps\t                            21.37 MB\n11 She Got Mine.flac 44.1kHz  872 kbps\t                            15.87 MB\n12 Good Like You.flac 44.1kHz 842 kbps\t                            26.62 MB\n13 One Day At A Time.flac 44.1kHz 858 kbps\t                    17.96 MB\n14 Now.flac 44.1kHz 849 kbps\t                                    29.18 MB\n15 Nanibali.flac 44.1kHz 741 kbps\t                            23.68 MB\n16 Currency Of Love (Bonus Track).flac 44.1kHz 842 kbps\t            22.75 MB\nEric Bibb - Jericho Road.m3u\t                                     1.95 KB\nJericho Road.cue\t                                             1.79 KB\nz. audiochecker main log file.log\t                             3.53 KB\nz. audiochecker.log\t                                             1006 bytes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc0f48390a355e4140e9146651e227f91b4a8cfe","amp;dn":"Eric+Bibb+-+Jericho+Road+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc0f48390a355e4140e9146651e227f91b4a8cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,15,72,57,10,53,94,65,64,233,20,102,81,226,39,249,27,74,140,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
