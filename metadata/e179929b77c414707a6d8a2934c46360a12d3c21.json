This is especially so on &quot;Not So Manic Now&quot; about a girl unable to leave her flat since she was assaulted and &quot;Just A Girl She Said&quot;, a cold study of an emotionally abusive sexual relationship delivered in authentically numb tones by Halifax-born vocalist Sarah Blackwood. Whereas The Beautiful South revel in semi-detached greyness, however, and Morrissey is prone to lyrically provocative gestures, Dubstar match the deadpan restraint of their lyrics with a sparkling techno-indie soundtrack, courtesy of Chris Wilkie's janglepop guitar and programmer Steve Wilkie's layers of synthesizer. The sumptuous &quot;Stars&quot; and ska-flecked &quot;Elevator Song&quot; in particular hint at a backdrop of teasing glamour and neon lights against which disappointingly ordinary lives are led.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Stars\n[02] Anywhere\n[03] Just A Girl She Said\n[04] Elevator Song\n[05] The Day I See You Again\n[06] Week In Week Out\n[07] Not So Manic Now\n[08] Popdorian\n[09] Not Once, Not Ever\n[10] St. Swithin's Day\n[11] Disgraceful\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:43m:12s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 113mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 09 October 1995\n\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dubstar.org.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dubstar.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstar&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e179929b77c414707a6d8a2934c46360a12d3c21","amp;dn":"%5B1995%5D+Disgraceful+-+Dubstar+-+113mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e179929b77c414707a6d8a2934c46360a12d3c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,121,146,155,119,196,20,112,122,109,138,41,52,196,99,96,161,45,60,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
