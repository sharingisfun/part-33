This mini-series profiles the perils, struggles and triumphs of four of history's treasure seekers. In glass cases and dusty corners of great international museums of North America and Europe, thousands of their priceless relics &amp; treasures are displayed. All are fascinating in their own right for what they tell us of lost tribes, lost cultures, even lost civilizations. But the real stories are rarely told--the blood-stirring adventures of the travelers who braved swamp fever, cannibals, sandstorms &amp; other perils to capture the treasures. Michael Rockefeller; Lord Elgin; Giovanni Belzoni; and Edward Thompson were all men of guile &amp; daring in the tradition of Indiana Jones. They travelled to the ends of the Earth in search of archeological riches of ancient and exotic cultures. Includes staged re-enactments, interviews, personal journal accounts, original film footage and unpublished photography.\n\nNarrated by Jeremy Irons\nSeries Producer : Anthony Geffen\n\nProduced by Atlantic Productions for the Discovery Channel\n\nDiscovery Communications Inc. (1995)\n\n\n\nEpisode 1 : The Michael Rockefeller Story\n\nIn 1961, newspaper headlines across America were dominated by the story of the mysterious disappearance of Michael Rockefeller, the youngest son of Nelson Rockefeller, off the coast of New Guinea. Enthralled by the war-like Stone Age tribes living there, Michael had journeyed into the country's formidable interior to document their disappearing way of life and to assemble a museum collection of their extraordinary artifacts. He never returned -- drowned after capsizing in a canoe or, perhaps, killed by local tribesmen. His death remains a mystery to this day.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n----------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2076 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 608x368\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.652:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:05.880\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f1408bd1e9246eb88ef2dc962a6bd53d991647","amp;dn":"DC.Seekers.of.the.Lost.Treasure.1of4.The.Michael.Rockefeller.Sto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f1408bd1e9246eb88ef2dc962a6bd53d991647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,241,64,139,209,233,36,110,184,142,242,220,150,42,107,213,61,153,22,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
