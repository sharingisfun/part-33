After All This Time\n\n\n\n\nIf My Ancestors Could See Me Now is a fantastic album by a fantastic musician, Ivan Neville. Ivan is a multi-instrumentalist and the son of the great singer, Aaron Neville. It was released in 1988. I guess you could describe it as two parts funk, one part new wave and one part rock and roll. Toss in a little blues as well. It did well but nothing special, sales wise. It did much better with the critics.\n\nUnfortunately something went bad shortly thereafter. There was a fall out between Ivan and his then label Polydor. Due to that rift you just cannot find this thing any longer. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s item at this point. Polydor pulling the album killed not only the discs momentum but also that of the artist. He wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have another release until 1995, a seven year gap. The feud appears to have not stopped either. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen YouTube postings of songs from the album pulled on a very regular basis. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve added a few to the playlist below. What them as soon as you can. Who knows when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be gone? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real shame if you ask me. This is such a killer record.\n\nLuckily for us Ivan didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disappear during those seven years. He was busy playing with the likes of Robbie Robertson and of course The Neville Brothers. He also is a member of Keith RichardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s X-Pensive Winos. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Not Just Another GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the best known song. Next up was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Falling Out of Love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The first two songs on the disc, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Primitive ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were my faves. Special mention also for Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Out In The Streets.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThere are some amazing players on this album. Jeff Porcaro(drums), Steve Jordan (drums, percussion), Jim Keltner (percussion), Danny Kortchmar (sax, keys, guitar), Randy Jackson (bass), Bonnie Raitt and J.D. Souther (backing vocals) and Waddy Wachtel (guitar). Ivan played bass, keyboards and added the vocals. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one heck of a line-up.\n\nIvan Neville, If My Ancestors Could See Me Now peaked at #107 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart. The single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Not Just Another GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ peaked at #26 on the Top 100 Singles Chart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb396acc0b16503e647f4908b9eb3b628efc010","amp;dn":"Ivan+Neville+-+If+My+Ancestors+Could+See+Me+Now+%5B1988%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb396acc0b16503e647f4908b9eb3b628efc010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,179,150,172,192,177,101,3,230,71,244,144,139,158,179,182,40,239,192,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
