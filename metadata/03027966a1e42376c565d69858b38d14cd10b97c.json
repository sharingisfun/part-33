The Robin Hood of modern crime returns! He robs from the evil and heartless rich, and gives to the wronged and deserving poor - in the process, keeping a percentage for his own expenses. He doesn't work for the law, the government, or anyone else. He is a lone wolf, an adventurer, a detective, a rogue, but always a gentleman! The Saint travels to Texas in pursuit of a man who has been sabotaging weapons factories, but when his quarry turns up burned to crisp, he has to contend with both the local police, a trio of mysterious men behind the sabotage, and a beautiful Russian. This issue is a preview of the upcoming graphic novel, and it will be the only time this story will be seen in color!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03027966a1e42376c565d69858b38d14cd10b97c","amp;dn":"Saint+0+%281440px+%26amp%3B+1920px-HD%29%28Re-em-DCP%29+%5BDCP-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03027966a1e42376c565d69858b38d14cd10b97c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,2,121,102,161,228,35,118,197,101,214,152,88,179,141,20,205,16,185,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
