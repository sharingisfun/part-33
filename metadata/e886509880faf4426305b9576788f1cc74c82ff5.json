An overexcited Roo, along with Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and Eeyore, pay Rabbit a visit to celebrate Easter. But instead of finding an Easter party they find a Spring Cleaning day celebration. Rabbit refuses to celebrate Easter and a very disappointed Roo tries to cheer him up. How can they celebrate Easter without the Easter Bunny? Past, present and future intertwine in this marvelous movie, as the characters jump from page to page, teaching everyone a very valuable lesson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e886509880faf4426305b9576788f1cc74c82ff5","amp;dn":"Nalle.Puh.Varkul.Med.Ru.2004.SWEDISH.DVDRip.Xvid-EXTREM-E.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e886509880faf4426305b9576788f1cc74c82ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,134,80,152,128,250,244,66,99,5,185,87,103,136,241,204,116,200,47,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
