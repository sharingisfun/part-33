This will be available on an EP for Japanese relief in which all earnings go to help those in the Pacific. This is not the full song, however the final version. I hope you enjoy the vibes and sounds inspired by this culture.\n\nThis song was released not too long ago after the earthquake in Japan. It has a really nice and original tune to it, and its super quick cutoff modulations in the main wobble bass are intense as hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d307893dc296b28de41c999a106d5be425446a","amp;dn":"Quartus+Saul+-+Hagakure+%28Cyberoptics+Remix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d307893dc296b28de41c999a106d5be425446a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,211,7,137,61,194,150,178,141,228,28,153,154,16,109,91,228,37,68,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
