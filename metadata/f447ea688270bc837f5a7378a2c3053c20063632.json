Much information is available across the primary literature, making it difficult to obtain an overall picture of the state-of-the-art. This volume brings together some of the leading researchers in the field from across the globe to present the potential these materials have, not only in developing and characterising novel materials but also the devices which can be fabricated from them. Topics featured in the book include Raman characterisation, industrial polymer materials, actuators and sensors and polymer reinforcement, with chapters prepared by highly-cited authors from across the globe. A valuable handbook for any academic or industrial laboratory, this book will appeal to newcomers to the field and established researchers alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f447ea688270bc837f5a7378a2c3053c20063632","amp;dn":"Carbon+Nanotube%26ndash%3BPolymer+Composites+-+Dimitrios+Tasis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f447ea688270bc837f5a7378a2c3053c20063632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,71,234,104,130,112,188,131,127,90,115,120,162,195,5,60,32,6,54,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
