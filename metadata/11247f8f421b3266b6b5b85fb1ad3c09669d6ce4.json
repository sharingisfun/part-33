A. Alekseev\n\nWith the discovery, between 1845 and 1847, of the principle of conservation of energy, the importance of energy for human life and progress was recognized, and scientists gave energy the romantic name of `The Queen of the World'. Some twenty years later scientists  discovered entropy, a measure of the dissipation of energy. This book outlines the history of the formulation of these two notions. Ideas and concepts that were crystallizing in the human mind for thousands of years as the result of observation, practical experience, and developments in technology are described, together with philosophers, scientists, engineers, and inventors who contributed to their formulation.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by U. M. Taube and was first published by Mir in 1986. \nPDF | OCR | 600 dpi | Bookmarked | Paginated | 208 pages | 17 MB\n\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\nContents\nIntroduction\nTHE QUEEN OF THE WORLD AND HER SHADOW 7\n\nTHE INVISIBLE QUEEN 15\nThe Man of Reason Showed in the Mirror of the Universe 15\nFrom the Forces of Gods to the Forces of Souls in Every Object 20\nEnergy and 2000 Years of Walking About 28\n&quot;Give Me a Place to Stand and I Will Move the World!&quot; 36\nThe Birth of the 'Motive Power of Fire' 41\nIn the Gloom of Religious and Political Cataclysms 44\nRenaissance.
