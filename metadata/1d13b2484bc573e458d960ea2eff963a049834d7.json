The music is often funky and played with spirit although the orchestra occasionally sounds like a somewhat anonymous stage band that had not fully developed its own individual personality yet. Jerry Weldon and Doug Miller have a good tenor battle on &quot;Blues Up &amp; Down,&quot; altoist Rob Middleton and his brother Andy (on soprano) are in fine form on &quot;Two Brothers&quot; and Hampton has little difficulty finding fresh statements to make on this modern material.\n\n(Note: The audiochecker.log file is included, but that program obviously has its weaknesses. On this disc it returned 5 of the 7 tracks as MPEG, 1 as CDDA and 1 as ERROR on both the EAC rip in this torrent as well as the same rip by dbpoweramp. Both the EAC log and the Accurate Rip log are also included for any doubters.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d13b2484bc573e458d960ea2eff963a049834d7","amp;dn":"Lionel+Hampton+-+Cookin%27+In+The+Kitchen+%281990%29+%5BFLAC+EAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d13b2484bc573e458d960ea2eff963a049834d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,19,178,72,75,197,115,228,88,217,96,234,46,255,150,58,4,152,52,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
