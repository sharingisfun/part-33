He takes up football, and school, after a rich, white, Evangelical family plucks him from the streets. Then two great forces alter Oher: the family's love and the evolution of professional football itself into a game in which the quarterback must be protected at any cost. Our protagonist becomes the priceless package of size, speed, and agility necessary to guard the quarterback's greatest vulnerability: his blind side.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac6c8be744218998e9a572c090b85e23328cbd3","amp;dn":"The+Blind+Side%3A+Evolution+of+a+Game+-+Michael+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac6c8be744218998e9a572c090b85e23328cbd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,198,200,190,116,66,24,153,142,154,87,44,9,11,133,226,51,40,203,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
