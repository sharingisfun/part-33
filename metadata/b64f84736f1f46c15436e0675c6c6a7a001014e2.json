Smart and handsome, he moves them with his message, and when he calls for donations to his charity, the money pours in. Only thing is, Sam doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe a word heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saying. Just months earlier, Sam was a college senior on the path to law school. But when a surprise tuition bill leaves him thousands of dollars in the hole, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forced to think outside the box. Convincing his three roommates they can make a killing exploiting the gullible church crowd, the guys start a sham charity and begin campaigning across the country, raising funds for a cause as fake as their message.\n\nDirector: Will Bakke\n\nWriters: Michael B Allen, Will Bakke\n\nActors: Alex Russell, Zachary Knighton, Johanna Braddy, Miles Fisher, Sinqua Walls, Max Adler, Nick Offerman, Christopher McDonald\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 33 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b64f84736f1f46c15436e0675c6c6a7a001014e2","amp;dn":"Believe+Me.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b64f84736f1f46c15436e0675c6c6a7a001014e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,79,132,115,111,31,70,193,84,54,224,103,92,108,106,122,0,16,20,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
