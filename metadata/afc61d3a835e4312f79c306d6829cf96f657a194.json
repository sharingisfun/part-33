I burned the data file to the root folder of a CD &amp; setup.exe to a Setup subfolder.  Then ran setup.exe from the CD.  During install, I didn't bother with the Word macro thingy - sounds nice but I don't expect it still works on Word X. This allows you to run from the CD.  Use Daemon Tools to run from disk - see www.serve.com url below.\n\nOUP are doing a cheap upgrade to version 3, so if neologisms are your thing you might consider visiting their website to buy the upgrade - well, I tried!\n\nProblems?\nAmazon.com rated this 5-star for content &amp; 0-star for software &amp; I agree! \nHowever the main software problems have workarounds which are documented in excruciating detail at &lt;a href=http://www.serve.com/xywwweb/oed.shtml&gt;http://www.serve.com/xywwweb/oed.shtml&lt;/a&gt; .  \nHere you can learn how to rescue fonts, mount the dictionary on a hard drive and overcome startup GPFs, all of which I have done successfully by following the instructions.  I now have OED working on XP &amp; a w2k pcs. If you're a 'tinkerer' you can do it: you will end up with an amazing resource, \notherwise you might be best advised to leave it alone, as it may not work \nstraight out of the box.\n\nMany thanks to R.J.Holmgren for a wonderful job.  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afc61d3a835e4312f79c306d6829cf96f657a194","amp;dn":"Oxford+English+Dictonary+2nd+Edition+%28v1.14%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afc61d3a835e4312f79c306d6829cf96f657a194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,198,29,58,131,94,67,18,247,156,48,109,104,41,207,150,246,87,161,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
