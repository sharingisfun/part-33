No mystery here: In this case, the butler really did do it. But that's only the beginning in a puzzler that will span 20 years, when Wimsey inadvertently returns to the scene of the crime and steps into some &quot;damn bad business&quot; involving a recently discovered mutilated body. He discovers at the bottom of a well and in a church tower baffling clues that harken back to that fateful robbery and the still-missing jewels. The nine tailors, by the way, refers to nine church bells and the arcane tradition of change ringing. This entry in the Wimsey series offers the usual pleasures of splendid acting, colorful characters, and intriguing story. We also get to see how Bunter became Wimsey's faithful manservant. Suffice to say, The Nine Tailors will really ring your bell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:279d98c8c22528d018c186da7ab92ced7155ee41","amp;dn":"Lord+Peter+Wimsey+-+The+Nine+Tailors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"279d98c8c22528d018c186da7ab92ced7155ee41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,157,152,200,194,37,40,208,24,193,134,218,122,185,44,237,113,85,238,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
