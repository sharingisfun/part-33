They are one of the longest standing groups still recording and performing in 2008. Their career can best be divided in three parts. First the Golden Age (1948-1963) when the recorded for labels as Specialty and  Vee Jay. In the second phase of their career (1965-1989) they recorded for HOB, Jewel, Wajji, Messiah and others, can best be described as the Middle Stage. The third phase (1992 - today), or the Crossover Stage, is the period when they recorded for Major Record Companies and are selling more albums than ever. On this page we focus on the Middle Stage of their career, because it's the least well documented phase, even their own website doesn't have a lot about this period.\n\nWhen Vee-Jay went bankrupt in 1965, The Boys were without a contract. New York based HOB was quick to pick them up and sign them. At that time HOB was becoming one of the leading labels in gospel music, in what were trying times for traditional Gospel Ã¢â‚¬ËœquartetsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.  There was not much of a market for their music outside of Church. Although they continued to get work, the 'money was gettin' funny', and arguments within the group began to drive them apart. During the late sixties it became a common practice in the world of Gospel Music to give the lead vocalist a more prominent position. On many of the HOB released 45Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s the group was advertised as Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys of Alabama. Clarence Fountain apparently felt that he was the 'star', and that he should be paid more than the other founding members. This wasn't going to fly, and so he left The Blind Boys in 1969. The Boys continued recording albums (but almost no 45Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s) for HOB well into the seventies.~Red Kelly &amp; Cies de Theije (justmovingon.info)\n\n01. Hold Me In The Heart Of Your Hand\n02.
