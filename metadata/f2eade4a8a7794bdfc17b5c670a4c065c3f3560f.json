Ranya focuses on the taqsim baladi -- a style of improvisation that starts slowly, building to a climax of exciting rhythms, faster steps and shimmies. During the live music demonstration, she analyzes the structure, common features and stylistic differences between men's and women's style baladi dancing, and offers a step-by-step explanation of what takes place at each transition in the music. This DVD is an excellent tool for any serious dancer. Running time: Disk 1 - 135 minutes, Disk 2 - 170 minutes\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2eade4a8a7794bdfc17b5c670a4c065c3f3560f","amp;dn":"Bellydance+Egyptian+Style+-+The+Baladi+-+2-DVD+with+Ranya+Renee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2eade4a8a7794bdfc17b5c670a4c065c3f3560f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,234,222,74,138,119,148,189,252,23,181,198,112,164,192,101,195,243,86,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
