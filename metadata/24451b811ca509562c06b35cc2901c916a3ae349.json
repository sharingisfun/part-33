It is a player-driven, persistent-world MMORPG set in a science fiction space setting. Characters pilot customizable ships through a galaxy of over 7,500 star systems. Most star systems are connected to one or more other star systems by means of stargates. The star systems can contain moons, planets, stations, wormholes, asteroid belts and complexes.\n\nPlayers of Eve Online can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The character advancement system is based upon training skills in real time, even while not logged into the game.\n\n21 day trial invite  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=83bf9dd6-5d25-41ca-bd20-cbab37a7e597&amp;action=buddy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=83bf9dd6-5d25-41ca-bd20-cbab37a7e597&amp;action=buddy&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24451b811ca509562c06b35cc2901c916a3ae349","amp;dn":"EVE+Online+Retribution+Build+490872","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24451b811ca509562c06b35cc2901c916a3ae349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,69,27,129,28,165,9,86,44,6,179,92,194,144,28,145,106,58,227,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
