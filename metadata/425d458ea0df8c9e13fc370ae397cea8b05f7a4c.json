The hats, mittens, and scarves can be made in three sizes (for children ages 3 to 7) and require basic knitting skills that Jean guides you throughÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as some slightly more advanced techniques (intarsia, knitting in the round) should you wish to challenge yourself further. \n\nFinishing touches that give the wooly animals personality are as simple as a stitched mouth, some googly glued-on eyes, a pom-pom nose, or a few artfully placed buttons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425d458ea0df8c9e13fc370ae397cea8b05f7a4c","amp;dn":"Knitted+Critters+for+Kids+to+Wear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425d458ea0df8c9e13fc370ae397cea8b05f7a4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,93,69,142,160,223,140,158,19,252,55,10,227,151,206,168,176,95,122,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
