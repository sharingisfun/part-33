Beer Garden 01:54\n\n\n\nWith one foot rooted in the folk music tradition of story-telling, the poetry of spoken-word, and the other planted in a childhood love of South African music, psychedelic folk pop and a smattering of jazz, Mark Berube has a broad and eclectic base from which to build his albums, all bound together by his warmly potent voice. And this is exactly what we get with his new album titled Russian Dolls, out November 5th on Bonsound! Kristina Koropecki, BerubeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shadowy co-conspirator, adds layers of cello, autoharp, saw and a classical music vocabulary to the mix, resulting in rich, lush and adventurous sonic landscapes. Russian Dolls weds the epic to the intimate, the acoustic to the synthetic, the past to the future in delightful ways, always leaving the listener to wonder what will be revealed behind the next door","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30681eaaefe28ef307e5b7bc3022a148d1b6dfe4","amp;dn":"Mark+Berube+-+Russian+Dolls+%5B2013%5D++%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30681eaaefe28ef307e5b7bc3022a148d1b6dfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,104,30,170,239,226,142,243,7,229,183,188,48,34,161,72,209,182,223,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
