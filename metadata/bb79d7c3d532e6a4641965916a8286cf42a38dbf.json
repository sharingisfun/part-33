The album's name is a self explanatory message taken from the first track &quot;No, No, No&quot; Part 2 and is a collection of their remixes. The album consists of a blend of R&amp;B and dance remixes recorded from 1997 to 2002. The album was released on March 8, 2002 (see 2002 in music) and debuted and peaked at number 29 on the U.S. Billboard 200. \nThe album is a collection of the most relevant remixes of Destiny's Child (and some bonus tracks). It is especially notable for containing several resung remixes. The first of these resung remixes (and their first &quot;remix&quot; ever), &quot;No, No, No (Part II)&quot; is present on this collection. Other major urban remixes that have been resung include &quot;Say My Name (Timbaland Remix)&quot;, &quot;Bootylicious (Rockwilder Remix), &quot;Bug A Boo&quot; (Refugee Camp Remix), and &quot;Emotion (Neptunes Remix)&quot;. In terms of major urban remixes that have not been resung, the album also collects the &quot;Survivor (Remix)&quot; which features Da Brat. The album is not completely littered with R&amp;B remixes, and features dance remixes mainly remixed by Maurice Joshua. His remixes on this album include &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot; (Maurice's Xclusive Livegig Mix)&quot;, &quot;Nasty Girl (Azza's Nu Soul Mix)&quot;, and &quot;So Good (Maurice's Soul Remix)&quot;. In terms of other dance mixes, the album also contains a dance/rhythmic remix of &quot;Dot (E-Poppi Mix)&quot;. As mentioned above, the album also contains some bonus tracks that don't quite fit the traditional mold of a strictly dance or R&amp;B remix. First, the album contains a remix medley of &quot;Jumpin' Jumpin'&quot; that blends the So So Def Remix of the song featuring original members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson with the Maurice's Jumpin Retro Mix in a nonstop, but seamless hybrid. This mix of the song is a rare remix exclusive only to this album; it also contains vocals by Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. The album goes on with the bonus tracks by including &quot;Independent Women (Part II), which is supposed to be the second part of the song (but ironically, this part was written before &quot;Independent Women (Part I)&quot;. The album finally reaches closure and ends with a relative oddity, Michelle Williams's first single from her first album, the gospel influenced &quot;Heard A Word&quot; with a distinct sax sound which was later removed for the album version.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] No, No, No Part 2\t&gt; Featuring Wyclef Jean [Extended]\n[02] Emotion\t&gt; (The Neptunes Remix)\n[03] Bootylicious\t&gt; (Rockwilder Remix)\n[04] Say My Name\t&gt; (Timbaland Remix)\n[05] Bug A Boo\t&gt; Featuring Wyclef Jean\n[06] Dot\t&gt; (The E-Poppi Remix)\n[07] Survivor\t&gt; Featuring Da Brat\n[08] Independent Women Part II \n[09] Nasty Girl\t&gt; (Azzu's Nu Soul Mix)\n[10] Jumpin', Jumpin'\t&gt; Featuring Jermaine Dupri, Lil Bow Wow &amp; Da Brat (Remix Extended Version)\n[11] Bills, Bills, Bills\t&gt; (Maurice's Xclusive Livegig Mix)\n[12] So Good \t&gt; (Maurice's Soul Mix)\n[13] Heard A Word \t&gt; Michelle Williams\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:58m:11s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 139mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.8.0.2.20 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Pop Dance\nRelease Date\t&gt; 08 March 2002\nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt;\n\n&gt; [url]http://www.destinyschild.com[/url] \n&gt;\n&gt; [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny's_Child[/url]\n&gt; [url]http://www.azlyrics.com/d/destinys.html[/url]\n&gt; [url]http://www.muzu.tv/destinyschild[/url]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb79d7c3d532e6a4641965916a8286cf42a38dbf","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+This+Is+The+Remix+-+Destinys+Child+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb79d7c3d532e6a4641965916a8286cf42a38dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,121,215,195,213,50,230,164,100,25,101,145,106,130,134,207,66,163,141,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
