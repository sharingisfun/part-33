The song was not released on any of their studio albums, instead appearing on their compilation Black Market Clash. Upon its 1980 release as a single (initially available in the UK on import only) it peaked at #12 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe song haphazardly chronicles the life of the narrator's father, the bankrobber of the song's title (who &quot;never hurt nobody&quot;), concentrating on the theme of the drudgery of many working class jobs.\n\nYoung Ian Brown and Pete Garner - later of The Stone Roses - were in attendance at the studio recording session of this single.\n\nThe Clash filmed a low-budget video for the song, depicting members of the band recording the song in the studio, interspersed with Clash roadies Baker and Johnny Green wearing bandanas over their faces, performing a bank heist in Lewisham. During the filming, Baker and Green were stopped and questioned by the police, who thought they were the real thing.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrobber&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrobber&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaBdmaADe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaBdmaADe&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video 768x576 25.00fps 6062kbps\n   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo stereo 165kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:20\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
