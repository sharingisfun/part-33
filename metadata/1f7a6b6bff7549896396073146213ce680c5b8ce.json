For two years he and other residents of Jones County engaged in an insurrection that would have repercussions far beyond the scope of the Civil War. In this dramatic account of an almost forgotten chapter of American history, Sally Jenkins and John Stauffer upend the traditional myth of the Confederacy as a heroic and unified Lost Cause, revealing the fractures within Civil-War era Southern society. No man better exemplified these complexities than Newton Knight, a pro-Union sympathizer in the deep South who refused to fight a rich manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war for slavery and cotton.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lively. . . . Jenkins and Stauffer bring historical contexts to life and offer provocative interpretations.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Moving and powerful. . . . An important story that personalizes what remains abstract and counterintuitive in much of our received history of the Civil War, even as we approach its 150th anniversary.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Washington Post\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Informed. . . . Impressive. . . . The saga is related in fascinating detail.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Just when you thought you had heard it all about the Civil War, along comes this astonishing tale of rebellion within the heart of rebel territory. This is a riveting and memorable read about resistance, courage, love and, most of all, the long trail of justice and injustice in the American South. I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put it down.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Tom Brokaw\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Jenkins and Stauffer have brought fresh attention to a little-known and interesting sidebar of Civil War history.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Wall Street Journal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f7a6b6bff7549896396073146213ce680c5b8ce","amp;dn":"Sally+Jenkins+-+The+State+of+Jones-+The+Small+Southern+County+th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f7a6b6bff7549896396073146213ce680c5b8ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,122,107,107,255,117,73,137,99,150,7,49,70,33,60,230,128,197,184,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
