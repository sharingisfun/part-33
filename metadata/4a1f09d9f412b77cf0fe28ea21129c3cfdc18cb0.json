Based on a ten-year investigation, journalist Leslie KeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new book pulls back the curtain on the incredible occurrences of unexplained behavior by unknown objects over many decades, and the results are astonishing.\n\nWe know that of all UFO sightings reported, 95 percent can be explained as ordinary phenomena. However, within that remaining 5 percent, spectacular well-documented UFO events have been officially investigated by government agencies around the world, yet no conventional explanations were found.\n\nIn combination with her own insightful research, Kean has brought together over a dozen highly credible aviation witnesses and official investigators ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including five generals and a former U.S. governor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who reveal the facts about UFOs in riveting, personal accounts written exclusively for this book. John Podesta, White House Chief of Staff to President Clinton and co-chair of President ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transition team, provides a foreword. Kean offers a practical and achievable plan for US Government involvement in a step-by-step process to uncover what these unidentified objects are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and ultimately, what they may mean for all of us.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLeslie KeanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record informs readers at every level of knowledge and belief.

Petersen, Founder and President of the Arlington Institute\n\n\nSynopsis\n\nAn Air Force major is ordered to approach a brilliant UFO in his Phantom jet over Tehran. He repeatedly attempts to engage and fire on unusual objects heading right towards his aircraft, but his missile control is locked and disabled. Witnessed from the ground, this dogfight becomes the subject of a secret report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn Belgium, an Air Force colonel investigates a series of widespread sightings of unidentified triangular objects, and he sends F-16s to attempt a closer look. Many hundreds of eye witnesses, including on-duty police officers, file reports, and a spectacular photograph of an unidentifiable craft is retrieved and analyzed.\n\nHere at home, a retired chief of the FAAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Accidents and Investigations Division reveals the agencyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to a thirty-minute encounter between an aircraft and a gigantic UFO over Alaska, which occurred during his watch and is documented on radar.\n\nNow, all three of these distinguished men have written breathtaking, firsthand accounts about these extraordinary incidents. They are joined by Air Force generals and a host of high-level sources ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including Fife Symington III, former governor of Arizona and Nick Pope, former head of the British Defence MinistryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s UFO Investigative Unit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who have agreed to write their own detailed, personal stories about UFO encounters and investigations, for the first time.\n\nThey are coming forward now because of Leslie Kean, an investigative reporter who has spent the last ten years studying the still unexplained UFO phenomenon. Kean reviewed hundreds of government documents, aviation reports, radar data, and case studies with corroborating physical evidence. She carefully examined scientifically-analyzed photographs and interviewed dozens of high-level officials and aviation witnesses from around the world. With the support of former White House Chief-of-Staff John Podesta, Kean draws on her research to separate fact from fiction and to lift the veil on decades of U.S. government misinformation. Throughout, she presents irrefutable evidence that unknown flying objects ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ metallic, luminous, and seemingly able to maneuver in ways that defy the laws of physics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ actually exist.\n\nNo one yet knows what these objects are, even though they affect aviation safety and possibly national security. The phenomenon has been officially acknowledged by numerous foreign governments. For these reasons and many others, Kean concludes that the UFO problem must be more widely recognized and ultimately solved through an unbiased scientific investigation. The material presented throughout this landmark book is sobering, unflinching, and undeniably awe inspiring, and moves us towards a goal of properly addressing this worldwide mystery.\n\n\nThe Author\n\nLESLIE KEAN is an independent investigative journalist with a background in freelance writing and radio broadcasting.

Ffyfe Symington, John Podesta, Jimmy Carter and others and other government officials who have taken an interest in the UFO phenomenon. What inspired their interest, and how much are they willing to do to further the cause of official recognition of the UFO as a valid subject for study?\n\nThey also discuss Leslie's experiences in the media, and the surprisingly serious and open-minded reception she has been getting.\n\nHow do we take the UFO debate to the next step? For sixty years, the skeptics have controlled it, and made sure that it never goes beyond the issue of whether or not UFOs are real.\n\nBut the evidence is now overwhelming. They are real, and they have been displaying extraordinary technology for sixty years. They are not secret weapons. They are a genuine unknown. Leslie outlines what we all need to do to help get the debate out of the hands of the skeptics and take it to the next level. They are here. So the next question is: what are they? We need answers!\n\n-----------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a1f09d9f412b77cf0fe28ea21129c3cfdc18cb0","amp;dn":"UFOs%3A+Generals%2C+Pilots+and+Government+Officials+Go+On+the+Record","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a1f09d9f412b77cf0fe28ea21129c3cfdc18cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,31,9,217,244,18,183,124,240,254,40,234,33,18,156,60,253,193,140,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
