She took the boy to lunch at the McDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s across the street that day. And she continued to go back, again and again for the next four years until both their lives had changed dramatically. Nearly thirty years later, that young boy, Maurice, is married and has his own family. Now he works to change the lives of disadvantaged kids, just like the boy he used to be.\n\n     An Invisible Thread is the true story of the bond between a harried sales executive and an eleven-year-old boy who seemed destined for a life of poverty. It is the heartwarming story of a friendship that has spanned three decades and brought meaning to an over-scheduled professional and hope to a hungry and desperate boy living on the streets.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - January 1st 2011\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e38dd02ff4a610031cf9d76612c290b536ccb255","amp;dn":"An+Invisible+Thread+by+Laura+Schroff+and+Alex+Tresniowski+%28ePUB%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e38dd02ff4a610031cf9d76612c290b536ccb255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,141,208,47,244,166,16,3,28,249,215,102,18,194,144,181,54,204,178,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
