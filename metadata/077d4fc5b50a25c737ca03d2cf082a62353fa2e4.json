In this course, author Barton Poulson\nshows how to read, map, and illustrate data with\nProcessing, an open-source drawing and development\nenvironment. On top of a solid introduction to Processing\nitself, this course investigates methods for obtaining and\npreparing data, designing for data visualization, and\nbuilding an interactive experience out of a design. When\nyour visualization is complete, explore the options for\nsharing your work, whether uploading it to specialized\nwebsites, embedding the visualizations in your own web\npages, or even creating a desktop or Android app for your\nwork\n\nI - Unpack this collection of knowledge\nII - Mount or burn to access the wast information\nIII - Watch, read, learn and become all you can be","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077d4fc5b50a25c737ca03d2cf082a62353fa2e4","amp;dn":"Lynda+Interactive+Data+Visualization+with+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077d4fc5b50a25c737ca03d2cf082a62353fa2e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,125,79,197,181,10,37,199,55,202,3,210,207,8,42,98,53,63,162,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
