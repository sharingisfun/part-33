Starting his career as a musician by playing tangos and waltzes with harmonica, he notably made his reputation due to his envolvement in the bands Wigwam and Tasavallan Presidentti. In 1977 he recorded his first solo album &quot;Ajatuslapsi&quot; for pure electronics. In itself the album alternates complex plastic electro-acoustic sounds with kosmische mantric synth waves. A remarkable effort which also includes subtle cryptical / mystical flavours and metaphors. The record only now can be heard as it was originally intended; in 1977 it was impossible in Scandinavia to carve the levels to vinyl which were on the master tape. \n\nKotilainen additionally played on Jukka Tolonen's albums. He cemented himself as one of the first Finnish musicians to master the terrifying robotic scope of the moog. It's not like you can hear where this man started though. \n\nDiscography:\n\n    Ajatuslapsi (1977)\n    Aamu joella Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Morning by the River (1995)\n    Musiikkia nÃƒÂ¤ytelmÃƒÂ¤stÃƒÂ¤ Saatana saapuu Moskovaan (2001)\n    Turpeisen baari (2003)\n    Turquoise Planet (2009)\n    -51Ã‚Â°C (2010)\n    Soiva tehdas (2011)\n\nQuality: FLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b855546a789a4e330c54c016a3649ef1683d9505","amp;dn":"Esa+Kotilainen+-+SOLO-ALBUM+DISCOGRAPHY+%281977-2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b855546a789a4e330c54c016a3649ef1683d9505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,85,84,106,120,154,78,51,12,84,192,22,163,100,158,241,104,61,149,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
