One by one, they find their way into a deep, forested valley filled with wonderful and terrifying creatures...\n\nBone was drawn and written by Jeff Smith. Smith's black-and-white drawings were inspired by animated cartoons and comic strips, a notable influence being Walt Kelly's Pogo. Although essentially a high fantasy, Bone also displays slapstick humor. As the series progresses to graver issues and a more epic level, its characteristic use of broad humor lessens but continues to recur. Time Magazine has called the series &quot;as sweeping as the Lord of the Rings cycle, but much funnier.&quot;\n\nBone has received numerous awards, among them ten Eisner Awards and eleven Harvey Awards.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6ad281217df3c0045b6fbefeff136db32230e7","amp;dn":"Bone+by+Jeff+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6ad281217df3c0045b6fbefeff136db32230e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,106,210,129,33,125,243,192,4,91,111,190,254,255,19,109,179,34,48,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
