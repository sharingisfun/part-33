Comprised of vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist\nAndrew White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist Nick Baines,\nand drummer Nick Hodgson, Kaiser Chiefs resurrected the\nmod spirit of the Jam in &quot;I Predict a Riot,&quot; supercharged\nclass of &amp;#039;77 power pop that quickly electrified the\nBritish press when it was released in 2004. The song was\ninspired by Wilson&amp;#039;s days as a club DJ in Leeds, England,\nwhere the group was also formed. The single and Kaiser\nChiefs&amp;#039; pogo-inducing, boot-stomping live performances had\nthem pegged as rising stars in the neo-new wave revolution\nwith Franz Ferdinand, Dogs Die in Hot Cars, and the\nFutureheads. When Kaiser Chiefs&amp;#039; first 7&quot; &quot;Oh My God&quot;\nreached Number 66 on the U.K. charts -- a startling\nachievement for an unsigned band -- doors opened for the\ngroup to share the stage with larger acts, consequently\ngrabbing the attention of A&amp;R scouts who wanted to sign\nthem &quot;I Predict a Riot,&quot; on the other hand, reeled in U.S.\nmodern rock radio programmers caught in a blooming new\nwave revival. Without an American label deal, Kaiser\nChiefs (named after the South African football team)\ncrash-landed on some of the biggest U.S. alternative\nstations with the &quot;I Predict a Riot&quot; import single in late\n2004. That same year they recorded their debut album\nEmployment for the U.K. label B-Unique. The album was\nreleased domestically in the U.S. in spring 2005. The\ngroup&amp;#039;s follow-up, Yours Truly, Angry Mob arrived in the\nSpring of 2007.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a7e6f3b6003a3c2188eda2fd1551e56c60f5ae","amp;dn":"Kaiser_Chiefs-Live_from_Athens_%28MTV%29-DVBS-2008-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92a7e6f3b6003a3c2188eda2fd1551e56c60f5ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,167,230,243,182,0,58,60,33,136,237,162,253,21,81,229,108,96,245,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
