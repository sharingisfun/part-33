Louis Armstrong recorded for RCA during two separate times. During 1932-1933, he led an erratic (and under-rehearsed) big band on a series of numbers, but all of the selections have their moments of interest. Although not up to the level of his Hot Five and Seven recordings of five years earlier, these spirited tracks find Armstrong mostly in excellent form both instrumentally and vocally, and the reissue has four alternate takes never released before.\r\n\r\nHighlights include the two-part &quot;Hits Medley,&quot; &quot;That's My Home,&quot; &quot;I've Got the World on a String,&quot; &quot;There's a Cabin in the Pines,&quot; &quot;Hustlin' and Bustlin' for Baby,&quot; a unique 1930 collaboration with country singer Jimmie Rodgers, and the two bizarre versions of &quot;Laughin' Louis.&quot; The second half of the reissue features Armstrong during 1946-1947, including appearances with the Esquire poll winners (Louis takes a surprisingly modern solo on &quot;Snafu&quot;), the last titles by his big band, a few wonderful combo performances (including the classic &quot;Jack-Armstrong Blues&quot;), and the first songs by Armstrong's All-Stars (co-starring Jack Teagarden); this collection concludes with two unrelated 1956 orchestral tracks. Overall, this is wonderful music, although collectors who already have everything other than the alternates have a right to hesitate.\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01 - That's My Home\r\n02 - Hobo, You Can't Ride This Train\r\n03 - I Hate To Leave You Now\r\n04 - You'll Wish You'd Never Been Born\r\n05 - Medley Of Armstrong Hits - Part 1\r\n06 - Medley Of Armstrong Hits - Part 2\r\n07 - I've Got The World On A String\r\n08 - I Got A Right To Sing The Blues\r\n09 - Hustlin' And Bustlin' For Baby\r\n10 - Sittin' In The Dark\r\n11 - High Society\r\n12 - He's A Son Of The South\r\n13 - Some Sweet Day\r\n14 - Basin Street Blues\r\n15 - Honey, Do\r\n16 - Snowball\r\n17 - Mahogany Hall Stomp\r\n18 - Swing, You Cats\r\n\r\nCD2\r\n01 - Honey, Don't You Love Me Anymore\r\n02 - Mississippi Basin\r\n03 - Laughin' Louie\r\n04 - Tomorrow Night\r\n05 - Dusky Stevedore\r\n06 - There's A Cabin In The Pines\r\n07 - Mighty River\r\n08 - Sweet Sue, Just You\r\n09 - I Wonder Who\r\n10 - St. Louis Blues\r\n11 - Don't Play Me Cheap\r\n12 - That's My Home (Alternate Take)\r\n13 - Hobo, You Can't Ride This Train (Alternate Take)\r\n14 - I Hate To Leave You Now (Alternate Take)\r\n15 - You'll Wish You'd Never Been Born (Alternate Take)\r\n16 - Medley Of Armstrong Hits - Pt. 2 (Alternate Take)\r\n17 - Mississippi Basin (Alternate Take)\r\n18 - Laughin' Louie (Alternate Take)\r\n19 - Tomorrow Night (Alternate Take)\r\n20 - Blue Yodel No. 9\r\n\r\nCD3\r\n01 - Long, Long Journey\r\n02 - Snafu\r\n03 - Linger In My Arms A Little Longer\r\n04 - Whatta Ya Gonna Do\r\n05 - No Variety Blues\r\n06 - Joseph 'n' His Brudders\r\n07 - Back O' Town Blues\r\n08 - I Want A Little Girl\r\n09 - Sugar\r\n10 - Blues For Yesterday\r\n11 - Blues In The South\r\n12 - Endie\r\n13 - The Blues Are Brewin'\r\n14 - Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans\r\n15 - Where The Blues Were Born In New Orleans\r\n16 - Mahogany Hall Stomp\r\n17 - I Wonder, I Wonder, I Wonder\r\n18 - I Believe\r\n19 - Why Doubt My Love\r\n\r\nCD4\r\n01 - It Takes Time\r\n02 - You Don't Learn That In School\r\n03 - Ain't Misbehavin' (Live)\r\n04 - Rockin' Chair (Live)\r\n05 - Back O' Town Blues (Live)\r\n06 - Pennies From Heaven (Live)\r\n07 - Save It Pretty Mama (Live)\r\n08 - St. James Infirmary (Live)\r\n09 - Jack-Armstrong Blues\r\n10 - Rockin' Chair\r\n11 - Some Day You'll Be Sorry\r\n12 - Fifty-Fifty Blues\r\n13 - A Song Was Born\r\n14 - Please Stop Playin' Those Blues, Boy\r\n15 - Before Long\r\n16 - Lovely Weather We're Having\r\n17 - Rain, Rain\r\n18 - Never Saw A Better Day\r\n\r\n*2001 Bluebird / BMG | 09026-63846-2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing Thanks !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32545b4574180d45f8276aaa6d3dc968b7ee0649","amp;dn":"Louis+Armstrong+-+The+Complete+RCA+Victor+Recordings+%5BEAC-FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32545b4574180d45f8276aaa6d3dc968b7ee0649","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,84,91,69,116,24,13,69,248,39,106,170,109,61,201,104,183,238,6,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
