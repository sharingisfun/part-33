For decades, Lanier has drawn on his expertise and experience as a computer scientist, musician, and digital media pioneer to predict the revolutionary ways in which technology is transforming our culture.\n\nWho Owns the Future? is a visionary reckoning with the effects network technologies have had on our economy. Lanier asserts that the rise of digital networks led our economy into recession and decimated the middle class. Now, as technology flattens more and more industries?from media to medicine to manufacturing?we are facing even greater challenges to employment and personal wealth.\n\nBut there is an alternative to allowing technology to own our future. In this ambitious and deeply humane book, Lanier charts the path toward a new information economy that will stabilize the middle class and allow it to grow. It is time for ordinary people to be rewarded for what they do and share on the web.\n\nInsightful, original, and provocative, Who Owns the Future? is necessary reading for everyone who lives a part of their lives online.\n\nAuthor:\n\nJaron Lanier is a philosopher and computer scientist who has spent his career pushing the transformative power of modern technology to its limits. From coining the term 'Virtual Reality' to developing cutting-edge medical imaging and surgical techniques, Lanier is one of the premier designers and engineers at work today, and is linked with UC Berkeley and Microsoft. \n\nA musician with a collection of over 700 instruments, he has been recognised by Encyclopedia Britannica (but certainly not Wikipedia) as one of history's 300 or so greatest inventors and named one of the top one hundred public intellectuals in the world by Prospect and Foreign Policy. His first book, You Are Not A Gadget, was hailed as a 'poetic and prophetic' defence of the human in an age of machines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cdb184a67f7c69ec397594a3f2cc54d8d7758ac","amp;dn":"Who+Owns+the+Future+%282013%29+Jaron+Lanier+%28mobi%2Fepub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cdb184a67f7c69ec397594a3f2cc54d8d7758ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,219,24,74,103,247,198,158,195,151,89,74,63,44,197,77,141,119,88,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
