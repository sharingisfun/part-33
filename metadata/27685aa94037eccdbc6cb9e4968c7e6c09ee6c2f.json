It's nice to meet an idiot like myself. Some recognition maybe. Anyway we listened to some thousand songs. Most were beautiful, some clearly good and some were just to good to keep quiet. So I put these songs in my September lists (although most of them are a bit older but you might have missed them too). But whatever reason; in my ears, the list is quite special as it is. The songs really support each other. All in HQ.\n\nCould not wait to put it on the net. Usually I wait until it is busy (knowing people do not really search but just clicks what is passing by on page one) because then I have about 80% more uploads. Can be thousands. So.. This time however it for the one that searches. It could be here....
