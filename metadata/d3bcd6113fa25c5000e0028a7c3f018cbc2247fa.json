More than 550 full-color illustrations of internal structures are embedded into photographs of live models to show each muscle or muscle group, surrounding structures, surface landmarks, and the therapist's hands.\nStudents see clearly which muscle is being worked, where it is, where it is attached, how it can be accessed manually, what problems it can cause, and how treatment techniques are performed. This edition features improved illustrations of draping and includes palpation for each muscle. \n\nBasic Clinical Massage Therapy\nJames H Clay, David M Pounds\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBasic Clinical Massage Therapy: Integrating Anatomy and Treatment&quot;\nLippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins\nISBN: 0781756774\n654 pages\nPDF ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3bcd6113fa25c5000e0028a7c3f018cbc2247fa","amp;dn":"Basic+Clinical+Massage+Therapy+-+James+H+Clay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3bcd6113fa25c5000e0028a7c3f018cbc2247fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,188,214,17,63,162,92,80,0,224,2,138,124,63,1,140,188,34,71,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
