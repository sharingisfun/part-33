What are the chances of going to a theme park, on the other side of the coast, and meeting a person who will change your life as you know it? What are the chances of this person living on the island of San Juan, Puerto Rico, some 9,000 miles from your home in Napa Valley, California? What are the chances of a long-distance relationship such as this lasting very long? If you're California cartoonist Tom Beland and Puerto Rico journalist Lily Garcia, well, those chances are pretty good. &quot;Chances areÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; combines the first four issues of Tom Beland's Eisner-nominated autobiographical series &quot;True Story, Swear to God.&quot; A book that deals with the joys of meeting someone by chance and the heartache that comes with distance. It covers the humor, anxiety, annoyances and paranoia found in every relationship.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis TPB collects the first four issues of V1 which, with apologies, are all I have at the moment. I'll be uploading a complete V2 in a moment, but the earlier, small press issues are much harder to find. There is an Archive version of V1, but I don't have that yet, either.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb457b14ee3d92e917d4b57834db22b8174df94e","amp;dn":"True+Story%2C+Swear+To+God%3A+Chances+are%26hellip%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb457b14ee3d92e917d4b57834db22b8174df94e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,69,123,20,238,61,146,233,23,212,181,120,52,219,34,184,23,77,249,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
