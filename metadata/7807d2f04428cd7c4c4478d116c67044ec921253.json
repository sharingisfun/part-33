The band started to think of a play on words with &quot;Grind&quot; somewhere in the title, and ended up with &quot;Grind Finale&quot; since it would be the final (bigger) release from Nasum.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7807d2f04428cd7c4c4478d116c67044ec921253","amp;dn":"NASUM+-+Grind+Finale+%5B2005%5D+%5BGrindcore%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7807d2f04428cd7c4c4478d116c67044ec921253","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,7,210,240,68,40,205,124,76,68,120,209,22,198,112,68,236,146,18,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
