For example, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Evaluation CopyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for unactivated Windows, Ã¢â‚¬Å“For testing purpose onlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for beta or release candidate software, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Test ModeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when test signing mode is turned on, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Safe ModeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when user presses F8 to boot into Safe Mode and Ã¢â‚¬Å“This copy of Windows is not genuineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when Windows fails WGA validation.\n\nNot many people likes these watermark though, especially users who like to be the first to use new beta or RC builds of Windows OS, which always have Ã¢â‚¬Å“For testing purpose onlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Evaluation CopyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ watermark imprinted on a or all corner of desktop. Other than using the batch script watermark auto patcher to replace the user32.dll.mui with patched and watermark strings deleted version (Tip: Check out how to patch to remove the watermark on Windows), deepxw, the creator of reliable TCP-Z Half-Open Limit Auto Patcher, has also developed an utility aptly called, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Remove WatermarkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to remove all watermark on desktop.\n\nUnlike script-based watermark removal patch, Remove Watermark is an universal patch which automatically search for the sign of code strings that printed the watermark, and delete it from user32.dll.mui system file. It does not come with any already patched versions of user32.dll.mui. The technique allows Remove Watermark to theoretically support all future versions and service packs of Windows, and works on all language editions of Windows. Without carrying patched user32.dll.mui also makes the executable of Remove Watermark small in size.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0473fe13e96875b0d37f512258566678d7bde269","amp;dn":"RemoveWatermark+V0.8+%28x32+%26amp%3B+x64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0473fe13e96875b0d37f512258566678d7bde269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,115,254,19,233,104,117,176,211,127,81,34,88,86,102,120,215,189,226,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
