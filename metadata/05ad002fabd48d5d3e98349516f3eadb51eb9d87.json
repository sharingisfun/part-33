The band was founded by guitarist and vocalist David Davidson, bassist and vocalist Anthony Buda and drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne in 2000.\nThe band was originally known as Cryptic Warning, but it changed its name to Revocation in 2006. Revocation has released five studio albums, Empire of the Obscene, Existence Is Futile, Chaos of Forms, Revocation, and Deathless, in 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2014 respectively. The band signed to Relapse Records after their first album, which was released independently. They have also released a free EP, Teratogenesis, with Scion A/V in 2012.\n\nDeathless is the fifth studio album by American technical death metal band Revocation, released on October 14, 2014 by Metal Blade Records.\n\nAlex Newton at Sputnik Music wrote:\n\n\nQuote:\nRevocation has come a long way for a band once touted as a one-trick pony. Guitar virtuoso David Davidson is clearly still the focal point of the quartet, but his and drummer Phil Dubois-CoyneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time studying jazz at BostonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Berklee College of Music gives the band a veritable arsenal of songwriting techniques to play with. No album in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career covers such sonic territory as Deathless, and few in any genre so effortlessly integrate unconventional songwriting techniques as Revocation does here. Each album that Revocation has so far put out has had a slightly different identity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ breakthrough effort Existence Is Futile was balls-to-the-wall deathrash, while Chaos of Forms saw more experimentation in both melodic composition (Ã¢â‚¬Å“HarlotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fractal EntityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and song form (the inexorable build of highlight Ã¢â‚¬Å“Conjuring the CataclysmÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-titled smoothed things out a little, but arguably lacked a dynamite single. Fortunately, Deathless fixes that and then some, with a great mix of no-frills thrash and powerhouse cuts that encompass the best Revocation has to offer.\n\nMuch ado has been made about what genre Revocation fits into, and while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly a debatable question, there are far more interesting debates to be had about the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound (for the sake of argument, Revocation is a combination of death and thrash metal). Davidson and Brett BambergerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s array of high-voltage riffs point to thrash of the Megadeth and Pestilence mold, while the rhythm section has more in common with technical death metal. And then the band throws in something like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Madness Opus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which flirts with doom in its second half, or the bizarre dual-lead harmonies of Ã¢â‚¬Å“United Helotry,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and those labels begin to slip away. Davidson acknowledges Gorguts and Atheist as influences on his songwriting, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to see the overt technicality and jazz influence when Revocation trades in endless riffs for more exploratory compositions. Penultimate cut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Apex,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for instance, weaves its way through several instrumental sections that conclude with open-ended chords (major VII and diminished II show up multiple times), lending the song an intriguing sense of unpredictability as it charges onward.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Labyrinth of EyesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is perhaps the most surprising song here, as it sounds like Revocation by-the-numbers out of the gate before moving into Cynic territory with processed clean vocals and an extended jam featuring polyrhythmic passages that Dubois-Coyne anchors with a distant china symbol. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scorched Earth PolicyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is probably the best showcase of DavidsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite toy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ use of multiple modes within the same song. Basically, modes are the result of using a set of notes that belong to one scale in a different one; Davidson's mastery of these gives him freedom to wander between the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s base and various new directions which he explores during his solo forays. The albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grand finale, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Witch Trials,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ contrasts uplifting major chords with tritone-based riffs that lend credence to the sinister paranoia of the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title. After bursting from gate with a flurry of syncopated beats and slithering guitar lines, it breaks things up with solo passages and pounding grooves en route to an extended guitar solo that showcases DavidsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s uncanny control of the timbre and tone of his instrument.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track, on the other hand, is a departure from such adventures Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“DeathlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rides a huge clean chorus and unrelenting shredding to anchor all the musical chicanery around it, and might be the best combination of catchy and heavy since the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2010 single Ã¢â‚¬Å“No Funeral.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ As Revocation has continued to crank out new music every year or two (no long waits with these guys!), the quartet is continuing to improve in every area including songwriting and compositional balance. Regardless of genre or label, Revocation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to go outside its comfort zone, but the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solid technical and theoretical foundation allows it a great deal of leeway in such forays. Now five albums in, Davidson and company have more or less hit the bullÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye with Deathless; while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to figure what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do as an encore, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little doubt that it will be both somewhat unexpected and totally wicked.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;A Debt Owed to the Grave&quot;   4:52\n2. &quot;Deathless&quot;         4:57\n3. &quot;Labyrinth of Eyes&quot;   4:46\n4. &quot;Madness Opus&quot;   6:23\n5. &quot;Scorched Earth Policy&quot;   3:47\n6. &quot;The Blackest Reaches&quot;   4:07\n7. &quot;The Fix&quot;                    3:14\n8. &quot;United in Helotry&quot;       5:14\n9. &quot;Apex&quot; (Instrumental) 5:12\n10. &quot;Witch Trials&quot;   6:05\n11. &quot;Sworn to the Black&quot; (Morbid Angel cover)     4:02\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tTechnical Thrash / Death Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t121.50 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ad002fabd48d5d3e98349516f3eadb51eb9d87","amp;dn":"Revocation+-+Deathless+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ad002fabd48d5d3e98349516f3eadb51eb9d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,173,0,47,171,212,141,93,62,152,52,149,22,243,234,219,81,235,157,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
