Written by Charles Dickens; Full-cast dramatisation starring Julian Wadham, Margaret Tyzack, Jasmine Hyde and John Wood, with Ian McKellen as the narrator; Dramatised by Doug Lucie.\n\nThe youngest child of debtor William Dorrit, Amy is born in Marshalsea prison. She and her father are befriended by Arthur Clennam, whose mother employs 'little Dorrit' as a seamstress. The fortunes of the Dorrits undergo an extreme change when Williams inherits a fortune, and the family move to Italy. Back in England, Arthur Clennam finds himself the victim of a massive fraud and ends up in Marshalsea. There he is found by Little Dorrit, whose fortune has had no effect on her generosity and humility. Arthur realises that she loves him, but it is not until the Dorrit fortune is lost that the two of them can be united at last.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15994d7a232b11de99f5d2366e6c1eeb0976df8d","amp;dn":"Charles+Dickens+-+Little+Dorrit+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15994d7a232b11de99f5d2366e6c1eeb0976df8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,153,77,122,35,43,17,222,153,245,210,54,110,108,30,235,9,118,223,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
