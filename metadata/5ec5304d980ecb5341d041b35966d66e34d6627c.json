So when he got back to rock &amp; roll, \n&quot;Ringo&quot; in 1973 is where I started.\n\nThere were also some later albums that were unlistenable by my \nstandards, such as a Christmas album. Most of what Starr did in \nthe 1980s was as the Brits would say &quot;bloody awful&quot;. I only saved \ntwo tracks from that decade, and then in my playlist you'll see \na jump to 1992.\n\nNo live performances or the All-Star Band here either. \nJust the studio albums.\n\nI think you'll agree with many of my picks, and hope you \nenjoy The Executive Collection!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec5304d980ecb5341d041b35966d66e34d6627c","amp;dn":"RINGO+STARR+--+The+Executive+Collection+%28+1973+to+2009+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec5304d980ecb5341d041b35966d66e34d6627c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,197,48,77,152,14,203,83,65,208,65,179,89,102,214,110,52,214,98,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
