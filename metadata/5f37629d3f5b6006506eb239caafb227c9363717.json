This was a country project with Brendan Croker, Steve Phillips, and Knopfler's bandmate Guy Fletcher. They made just one album, Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time that was released in 1990, before returning to concentrate on their main bands. The Notting Hillbillies have been reunited several times for charity gigs. In May 1997 the Hillbillies went on an 11 show tour in UK.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
