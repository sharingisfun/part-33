Although his sound was influenced by Freddie Hubbard, Shaw's more advanced improvisations on his modal originals were quite original and fiery.  This Muse set has three of his compositions ( including 'In Case You Haven't Heard' ) and a song apiece from pianist Ronnie Mathews and bassist Stafford James; altoist Frank Strozier and drummer Eddie Moore complete the quintet.  The varied originals give the musicians strong foundations for their freewheeling and spontaneous solos, making this one of Woody Shaw's better recordings. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nWoody Shaw (Trumpet) \nFrank Strozier (Alto Saxophone) \nRonnie Matthews (Piano) \nStafford James (Bass) \nEddie Moore (Drums) \n\nWoody Shaw - Little Red's Fantasy Tracks:\n01  Jean Marie (Ronnie Mathews) 7:42 \n02  Sashianova (Stafford James) 10:00 \n03  In Case You Haven't Heard (Woody Shaw) 6:26 \n04  Little Red's Fantasy (Woody Shaw) 7:05 \n05  Tomorrow's Destiny (Woody Shaw) 7:46 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158d4039c76dabf32022d77c098290a9355b91eb","amp;dn":"Woody+Shaw+-+Little+Red%5C%27s+Fantasy+%281976%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158d4039c76dabf32022d77c098290a9355b91eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,141,64,57,199,109,171,243,32,34,215,124,9,130,144,169,53,91,145,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
