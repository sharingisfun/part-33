Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\n\nEpisode 133 - &quot;Watch What Happens Live From The Compound&quot;: Monocle sporting Ant begins today by discussing the plane crash in the French Alps, predicting the morbidly obsessed news reaction, Rat randomly tells us a story about learning to dance for his Bar Mitzvah, and Anthony reminisces about how funny Jim Norton was at Sam Roberts wedding. Ant then talks about watching &quot;Interstellar&quot; last night as well as Ã¢â‚¬Å¡&quot;Exodus: Gods and Kings&quot;, gets into a little &quot;radio news&quot; with Mancow joining WLUP, Andy Cohen getting his own channel over at SiriusXM, and then reads a Gawker article that doesn't speak too favorably about the Opie and Anthony Reddit. We take a look at a new George Zimmerman video, hear from the callers, find out the latest extreme measure Angelina Jolie has taken, and see a news story about some dummies in Utah getting &quot;catfishes&quot;. We also check out a couple of new Rev Al flubs, learn a valuable lesson about opening the door to strangers, look at shitty titty tattoos, hear a news story about some playground sexy time, watch a video promoting the Indiegogo for &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;, and chat about &quot;The X-Files&quot; returning. We are treated to a WTF video of &quot;Wasabi Woman&quot;, take a look at two teens who robbed and shot a man walking his dog, and Ant wraps up TACS by going through horrific circus accidents\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73de2a6cedb137d61cdf29bc21235fb2a5bd3b07","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-03-024+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73de2a6cedb137d61cdf29bc21235fb2a5bd3b07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,222,42,108,237,177,55,214,28,223,41,188,33,35,95,178,165,189,59,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
