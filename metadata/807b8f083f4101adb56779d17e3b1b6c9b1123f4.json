In any case, if you like crazy and implausible, 'X' marks the spot.\r\n\r\nDespite some of the pain it caused me, Agent X also provided, in the same package, a salve. The backstory: Five days before reviewing TNTâ€™s new spy/whatever drama, I tweaked my back and was barely walking around. By the fifth day, it was mostly better, thanks to loads of Advil. Then I watched the first hour of Agent X and laughed so hard I hurt myself again.\r\n\r\nBut I kept watching â€” and laughing â€” and realized Agent X could bring a lot of pleasure on a weekly basis as I create the inevitable Agent X Drinking Game. Anyway, the point is, youâ€™ve got to laugh to keep from crying.\r\n\r\nI should mention is that Agent X is not supposed to be a comedy. Itâ€™s a drama. TNT had a chance to get out in front of this thing and claim it as a spoof, but apparently that didnâ€™t occur to them. So unfortunately Agent X remains an intentional drama, one that is insanely but deliciously bad. Hilariously bad.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to explain the premise alone without laughing. Letâ€™s try: Agent X is about how newly elected vice president Sharon Stone (her show name is Natalie Maccabee but thatâ€™s only half as funny) finds out from an Alfred-like butler at the vice presidentâ€™s residence &quot;the greatest secret in the history of our country.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe secret is that the â€œrealâ€ Constitution (kept secret from everyone) â€“ follow along! â€“ contains a fifth section to article two, not just four sections like everybody thinks (meaning everybody who knows the Constitution, which in this country is basically nobody). Anyway, the secret fifth section states this (you might want to sit down): &quot;An agent of unknown identity is hereby authorized to serve at the discretion of the vice president for the purpose of aiding the Republic in times of dire peril.&quot;\r\n\r\nYep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:807b8f083f4101adb56779d17e3b1b6c9b1123f4","amp;dn":"Agent+X+-+Season+1+-++Episodes+1+thru+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"807b8f083f4101adb56779d17e3b1b6c9b1123f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,123,143,8,63,65,1,173,181,103,121,209,126,59,27,108,155,17,35,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
