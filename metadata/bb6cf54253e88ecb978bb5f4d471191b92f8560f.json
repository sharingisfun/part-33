'Maybe pebbles.'&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€From the Introduction\nInternationally acclaimed Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is considered to be one of the most brilliant and influential rabbis of our time. He has been lauded by Time magazine as a &quot;once-in-a-millennium scholar&quot; and by Ted Koppel of Nightline as &quot;one of the very few wise men that I've ever met.&quot;\nArthur KurzweilÃ¢â‚¬â€himself a Jewish scholar, author, teacher, publisher, and a longtime disciple of Rabbi SteinsaltzÃ¢â‚¬â€has gathered in one place a collection of &quot;pebbles&quot; of wisdom from Rabbi Steinsaltz. This wonderful book is filled with wisdom from more than thirty years of Rabbi Steinsaltz's lectures, writings, interviews, conversations, and reflections.\nPebbles of Wisdom includes Rabbi Steinsaltz's thoughts on the big topics of life including the meaning of happiness, the search for the purpose of one's life, the point of suffering, discovering oneself, dangers along the spiritual path, the process of transforming oneself, and the challenges of faith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb6cf54253e88ecb978bb5f4d471191b92f8560f","amp;dn":"Pebbles+of+Wisdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb6cf54253e88ecb978bb5f4d471191b92f8560f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,108,245,66,83,232,142,203,151,139,181,244,212,113,25,27,146,248,86,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
