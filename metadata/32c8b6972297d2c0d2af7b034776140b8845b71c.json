When she fails to return, her consort Moon, along with Stone and a party of warriors and hunters, must track them down. Finding them turns out to be the easy part; freeing them from an ancient trap hidden in the depths of the Reaches is much more difficult.\n\nThe Tale of Indigo and Cloud explores the history of the Indigo Cloud Court, long before Moon came to Court.
