Writer Dick Foreman was working with Nancy Collins during Collins' run on Swamp Thing, where he guest wrote three issues, one featuring Black Orchid. The series followed characters introduced in the Black Orchid mini-series by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean (who provided the covers for this volume) a few years earlier.\n \nBlack Orchid was not popular enough to last a full two years and was canceled at 22 issues. It is possible that the backlash of the children's crusade crossover hurt its sales instead of improving them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e733803d46b5e74e18217aefe687c726b2947f1","amp;dn":"Black+Orchid+%28001+-+022+%2B+Annual%29+%281993+-+1995%29+%28digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e733803d46b5e74e18217aefe687c726b2947f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,115,56,3,212,107,94,116,225,130,23,174,254,104,124,114,107,41,71,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
