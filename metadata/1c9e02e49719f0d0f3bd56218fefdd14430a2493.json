It is a loose adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's 1936 play of the same name.\nSellers plays Ahmed el Kabir, a socialist Indian doctor, who meets Epifania Parerga (Loren), a willful and arrogant heiress who has married to satisfy the conditions of her father's will but whose marriage has not produced the hoped-for happiness. Rather memorable performances are given by Alastair Sim, playing Julius Sagamore, the head of the millionairessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business empire, Vittorio de Sica as Joe, the proprietor of a pasta production sweatshop, and Alfie Bass as a self-employed Cockney fish curer.\nThe film was a huge hit in Britain at the time of its release, but received mixed reviews. However it was an international success. George Martin, who was the producer at that time of Peter Sellers' comedy recordings, conceived and instigated the writing and recording of a comedy duet &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot;, sung by Sellers and Loren in their film characters. Martin commissioned David Lee and Herbert Kretzmer to write the song. Martin himself produced the recording. Martin envisioned the song as a recording to be incorporated in the soundtrack of the film. The film's producers did not agree to this, but the studio was happy to see the song released as a stand-alone single to promote the film. The song became a UK chart hit in 1960 and succeeded in publicizing the film.\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 949 MiB\nDuration : 1h 30mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 472 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID : H264\nWidth : 688 pixels\nHeight : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.40:1\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.256\n\nAudio\n\nFormat : AC-3\nBit rate : 192 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9e02e49719f0d0f3bd56218fefdd14430a2493","amp;dn":"The+Millionairess+%281960%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9e02e49719f0d0f3bd56218fefdd14430a2493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,158,2,228,151,25,240,208,243,189,86,33,143,239,221,20,67,10,36,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
