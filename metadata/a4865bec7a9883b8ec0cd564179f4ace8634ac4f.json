Many Sleep CD's put you to sleep by wearing you out with sounds and music that aren't that soothing to listen to -- resulting in sleep that is not that peaceful or deep. This music harmoniously lulls you into a deep state of peace even before you go to sleep. Binaural Beats at two levels of Delta entrain your brain into a deep state of sleep and meditation. With headphones you get the extra benefit of having your left and right brain synchronized.\n\nAs background music, the CD is very relaxing. With full attention, the CD is also really effective for anxiety relief. \n\n60 min\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSource: WebRip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4865bec7a9883b8ec0cd564179f4ace8634ac4f","amp;dn":"Globe+Institute+-+Calm+Sleep+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4865bec7a9883b8ec0cd564179f4ace8634ac4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,134,91,236,122,152,131,184,236,12,213,100,23,159,74,206,134,52,172,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
