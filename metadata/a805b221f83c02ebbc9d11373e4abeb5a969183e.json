She has earned frequent comparison to some of the best Middle Eastern singers.\n\n Born in Lebanon, after graduation from high school, Ghada Shbeir moved to the USEK (Universite St. Esprit - Kaslik - Lebanon) to pursue a music career. Her big break came as a soloist of the USEK choir that highlighted her professional talent throughout the media.\n\n After earning an advanced degree with high distinction in traditional Arabic music performance, Ghada Shbeir received her Master's degree in Musicology from the same university. Due to her unique style in performing, she became a professor of traditional Arabic singing techniques at the USEK, AlMuwashshah singing techniques at the Lebanese University and sacred Syriac chants at the National Conservatory of Lebanon.\n\n Furthermore, she participated in several festivals, concerts and conventions. Ghada presented a lot of conferences in Lebanon and all over the world (Paris, London, Canada, Estonia, Slovakia, Greece, Egypt, Oman, Abu Dhabi, Spain, etc.) She has also worked with Ã¢â‚¬Å“EnchordaisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for five years. During this period, Ghada performed in many concerts and festivals, in addition to registering with Ã¢â‚¬Å“EnchordaisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a CD containing traditional Arabic music. Furthermore, she is working, not exclusively, with Zaman Production, in France for organising concerts in Europe.\n\n Interestingly, the lady not only can, but also finds pleasure in singing without musical accompaniment (known in the West as A Capella).\n\nRECORDINGS:\n - Chants Maronites de la NativiteIn participation with Naji Hakim (Organ) and the Choir of the Church of Notre Dame du Liban - Paris\n - Kiddissa Min Ardina\n\n\nDEGREES:\n\n    University Degree in Musicology [M.S.]\n    University Degree in Musicology [B.S.]\n    Musicology License","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a805b221f83c02ebbc9d11373e4abeb5a969183e","amp;dn":"Ghada+Shbeir+-+2011+-+Andalusia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a805b221f83c02ebbc9d11373e4abeb5a969183e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,5,178,33,248,60,2,235,188,157,17,55,62,74,190,181,169,105,24,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
