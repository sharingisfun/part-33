Along with Saul Bellow and Philip Roth, he was one of the best known American Jewish authors of the 20th century. His baseball novel, The Natural, was adapted into a 1984 film starring Robert Redford. His 1966 novel The Fixer, about antisemitism in Tsarist Russia, won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nMalamudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fiction touches lightly upon mythic elements and explores themes like isolation, class, and the conflict between bourgeois and artistic values.\n\nWriting in the second half of the twentieth century, Malamud was well aware of the social problems of his day: rootlessness, infidelity, abuse, divorce, and more. But he also depicted love as redemptive and sacrifice as uplifting. In his writings, success often depends on cooperation between antagonists. For example, in The Mourners landlord and tenant learn from each other's anguish. In The Magic Barrel, the matchmaker worries about his &quot;fallen&quot; daughter, while the daughter and the rabbinic student are drawn together by their need for love and salvation.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in ePUB format:\n\n* Dubin's Lives\n\n* The Assistant \n\n* The Complete Stories\n\n* The Fixer\n\n* The Natural\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Malamud&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Malamud&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3869/the-art-of-fiction-no-52-bernard-malamud&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3869/the-art-of-fiction-no-52-bernard-malamud&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/ref/books/author-malamud.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/ref/books/author-malamud.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/node/339&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/node/339&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5d439241b74c1cf91323cc690fe6715c0ec0817","amp;dn":"Bernard+Malamud+-+Novels+%26amp%3B+Stories+%285+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5d439241b74c1cf91323cc690fe6715c0ec0817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,212,57,36,27,116,193,207,145,50,60,198,144,254,103,21,192,236,8,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
