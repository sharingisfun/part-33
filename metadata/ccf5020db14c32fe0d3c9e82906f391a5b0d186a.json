Bruce Katz's contributions on B-3 Hammond organ expands McClain's sound, particularly on the &quot;Green Onions&quot;-influenced &quot;What You Want Me to Do.&quot; The sparsely effective arrangement on &quot;Here I Go Falling in Love Again&quot; brings McClain up front as he cries of being a soul stripped to the bare bones. Kevin Barry's funky bass blows while McClain declares himself as a child of God in &quot;Child of the Mighty Mighty.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\nA1 - Give it up to Love\nA2 - Too Proud\nA3 - What You Want Me To Do\nA4 - Here I Go Falling in Love Again\nA5 - Go To Have Your Love\nB1 - Child of the Mighty Mighty\nB2 - I'm Tired of These Blues\nB3 - I Feel Good\nB4 - Don't Turn Back Now\nB5 - Lonesome Road\n\nPersonnel:\nMighty Sam McClain vocals \nBruce Katz piano and Hammond B-3 organ \nKevin Barry guitar\nMichael Rivard bass \nLome Entress drums \nBennie Wallace tenor sax on Got To Have Your Love\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf5020db14c32fe0d3c9e82906f391a5b0d186a","amp;dn":"Mighty+Sam+McClain+-+1992+-+Give+it+up+to+Love+%28vinyl+24+96%29+FLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf5020db14c32fe0d3c9e82906f391a5b0d186a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,245,2,13,177,76,50,254,13,60,158,130,144,111,57,26,91,13,24,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
