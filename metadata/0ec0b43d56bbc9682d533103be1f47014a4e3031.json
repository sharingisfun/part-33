Unlike previous versions of the team, the new Secret Six consists mainly of villainous characters who undertake missions of dubious moral quality and often resulting in a high body count. In Birds of Prey issues #104-108, the Secret Six face off against Oracle's Birds of Prey in Russia for the soul of Tora (Ice). DC launched a new Secret Six series in September 2008, reuniting Catman, Deadshot, Scandal, and Rag Doll, and adding Bane (hinted at by Simone months earlier as &quot;an A-list Batman villain&quot;) and an original character named Jeannette, who appeared in the third issue. Secret Six was officially cancelled in July 2011 after 36 issues.\n\nDimensions - approximately 1350 x 2000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec0b43d56bbc9682d533103be1f47014a4e3031","amp;dn":"Secret+Six+Vol.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec0b43d56bbc9682d533103be1f47014a4e3031","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,192,180,61,86,187,201,104,45,83,49,3,190,31,71,1,74,78,48,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
