In A Gift of Hope, she shows us how she transformed that pain into a campaign of service that enriched her life beyond what she could imagine.\n \nFor eleven years, Danielle Steel took to the streets with a small team to help the homeless of San Francisco. She worked anonymously, visiting the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cribsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most vulnerable citizens under cover of darkness, distributing food, clothing, bedding, tools, and toiletries. She sought no publicity for her efforts and remained anonymous throughout. Now she is speaking to bring attention to their plight.\n \nIn this unflinchingly honest and deeply moving memoir, the famously private author speaks out publicly for the first time about her work among the most desperate members of our society. She offers achingly acute portraits of the people she met along the wayÃ¢â‚¬â€and issues a heartfelt call for more effective action to aid this vast, deprived population. Determined to supply the homeless with the basic necessities to keep them alive, she ends up giving them something far more powerful: a voice.\n \nBy turns candid and inspirational, Danielle SteelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A Gift of Hope is a true act of advocacy and love.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published -  October 30, 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0aba8628820fc6f14ebbcd523bf5a2a82757e3","amp;dn":"A+Gift+of+Hope+by+Danielle+Steel+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb0aba8628820fc6f14ebbcd523bf5a2a82757e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,10,186,134,40,130,15,198,241,78,187,205,82,59,245,162,168,39,87,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
