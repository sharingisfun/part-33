Frustrated and disappointed by the circumstances of war, Edwin Boyd is a man torn between the need to support his young family and an unfulfilled dream to head to Hollywood to become a star. When he discovers a way to satisfy all your needs (rob banks &quot;Hollywood style&quot;), her dream for stardom leads him down an unexpected path of gangsterism, danger and tragedy.\nA dramatic thriller format with excellent cinematography and a script apparently quite worked, despite the simplicity of the proposal. Without doubt, the greatest asset is its basis in fact, which brings realism to the plot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9fbf136f7083a05bf3d900dbd776240a75e8bbc","amp;dn":"Edwin+Boyd+%28Citizen+Gangster%29+%282012%29+%5BMICROHD+1080p%5D+%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9fbf136f7083a05bf3d900dbd776240a75e8bbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,251,241,54,247,8,58,5,191,61,144,13,189,119,98,64,167,94,139,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
