He was born January 15th, 1929. He was assassinated April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just 39 years old. While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed the cause of the poor and organized the Poor People's Campaign to address issues of economic justice. Dr. King was also a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy and the Vietnam War. We play his &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; speech, which he delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April 4, 1967, as well as his last speech, &quot;I Have Been to the Mountain Top,&quot; that he gave on April 3, 1968, the night before he was assassinated.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429749129f754fb059249628be23c16863d47183","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+16+jan+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429749129f754fb059249628be23c16863d47183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,151,73,18,159,117,79,176,89,36,150,40,190,35,193,104,99,212,113,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
