This is truly a work of art - with its clear explanations and its fantastic stereoscopic illustrations. Yes, it may be a little dated; and yes, it is definitely not an easy read; but its clarity of content and its sheer mathematical elegance make it more than worthwhile for any serious student of physics or engineering. And one thing is certain: anybody able to successfully complete and really understand the material presented in this book will have become VERY well versed in applied mathematics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af3055e751b31c72fced9a50b2cf8b60f4e4fa1f","amp;dn":"Methods+of+Theoretical+Physics+-+Parts+I%2CII+-+Morse+and+Feshbach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af3055e751b31c72fced9a50b2cf8b60f4e4fa1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,48,85,231,81,179,28,114,252,237,154,80,178,207,139,96,244,228,250,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
