They bring each other to a height of desire neither thought possible, but is it enough to overcome the differences that tear them apart? Kate Champion, a forty-two-year-old, married mother of two, leads an enviable upper class life of luxury. Her comfortable path takes an unexpected detour after a chance encounter at a neighborhood playground. Jaylee Inoa is a twenty-two-year-old, second generation New York Dominican with close ties to the Heights and the gangs that run them. Her life of privilege is no match for the code of the streets he navigates with ease. When a crime of the heart leads to a crime in the flesh, how far will she go to redeem him? Can she risk all in her life that is golden for the love of her golden-eyed man?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:453bf14ab849d72198e1fa2018884b2587dd30b2","amp;dn":"Heights+of+Desire+-+Mara+White+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"453bf14ab849d72198e1fa2018884b2587dd30b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,59,241,74,184,73,215,33,152,225,250,32,24,136,75,37,135,221,48,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
