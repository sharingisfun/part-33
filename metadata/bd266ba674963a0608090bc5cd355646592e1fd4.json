It is a jidaigeki (Japanese period drama) depicting the fall of Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), an aging Sengoku-era warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons. The story is based on legends of the daimyo MÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ri Motonari, as well as on the Shakespearean tragedy King Lear.\n\nRan was Kurosawa's last epic. With a budget of $12 million, it was the most expensive Japanese film ever produced up to that time.[1] After Ran, Kurosawa directed three other films before he died, but none on so large a scale. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of colorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Costume Design for her work on Ran. The distinctive Gustav Mahler-inspired film score, written by TÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½ru Takemitsu, plays in isolation with ambient sound muted.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nautilus-bt.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nautilus-bt.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd266ba674963a0608090bc5cd355646592e1fd4","amp;dn":"Ran+%281985%29+Akira+Kurosawa+%5BBDRip720p%5D+%5BMultiLang+-+MultiSub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd266ba674963a0608090bc5cd355646592e1fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,38,107,166,116,150,58,6,8,9,11,197,205,53,86,70,89,46,31,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
