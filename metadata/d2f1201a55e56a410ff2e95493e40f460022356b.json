NYPD Detective Adam Kamen leads the investigation, until a seemingly unrelated freak incident leaves him with a brain injury in the section known as &quot;Brodmann Area 10.&quot; When he recovers, Adam's perceptions of time are altered. He becomes slowly convinced that his bizarre condition could be tied directly to the &quot;Henry&quot; case Ã¢â‚¬â€ and that the key may lie in the ancient, mystical practice of trepanation.\n\nThanks goes to DTs for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
