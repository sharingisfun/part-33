It contains audio demos and installs a high quality TTS engine that supports over 25 languages and 40 voices. Or listen to the voice demos at\n\nFollow these steps to set up your voice:\n1) Install and run this app once\n2) Install free SVOX Classic Text-to-Speech Engine\n3) Go to Android Settings -&gt; Voice Input &amp; Output -&gt; Text-to-Speech settings, activate SvoxClassic at the bottom of the screen, then select SvoxClassic as the Default Engine.\n\nNotes:\n- Google Navigation requires that the Text-to-Speech voice matches the phone language. You can change the phone language in Android Settings -&gt; Language &amp; keyboard -&gt; Select language\n- If you receive error code 18 when trying to install a voice, the installation fails because of a locked file. Solutions are to mount the phone on your PC and manually remove Ã¢â‚¬Å“/mnt/secure/asec/smdl2tmp1.asecÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or an empty folder named Ã¢â‚¬Å“.android_secureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n- On Android 2.1 and earlier, only some apps, like Google Translation, support changing voices.\n\nRecent changes:\nNew layout lets you\n- enter a text and hear it spoken\n- save and load texts\n- share a spoken text with friends via Facebook, email, and other media\n- play with volume, pitch, and speed settings\n- access online support and helpful links\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d92bf1a26a24211aa3bbcf79a3bd3ed82bbd521e","amp;dn":"SVOX+Arabic+Malik+Voice+v2.2+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d92bf1a26a24211aa3bbcf79a3bd3ed82bbd521e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,43,241,162,106,36,33,26,163,187,207,121,163,189,62,216,43,189,82,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
