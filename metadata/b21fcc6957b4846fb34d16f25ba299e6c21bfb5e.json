I say animated comic strip because if youve seen the actual comic, the cartoon images are DIRECTLY from the pages. Its awesome, theres still animation in it, but this is Sam Kieth, uncorrupted. \n\nThese episodes aired in the mid-late 90s on Mtv&amp;#039;s Oddities.\n\nThese are not high quality, but having said that, they are great quality. You will not be disappointed.\n\nalso if you enjoy these, they follow the comic from issue 1-13, the series goes from 1-35, so if you like theres much more story out there, so:\n\nSupport your local comic store!\n\nThis is my first upload, hope these are some useful stats:\nDivx video\n320x240\n29fps\n253kbps datarate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b21fcc6957b4846fb34d16f25ba299e6c21bfb5e","amp;dn":"the+maxx+%28sam+keith%29+1-13+on+mtvs+oddities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b21fcc6957b4846fb34d16f25ba299e6c21bfb5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,31,204,105,87,180,132,111,179,77,22,242,91,162,153,230,194,27,251,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
