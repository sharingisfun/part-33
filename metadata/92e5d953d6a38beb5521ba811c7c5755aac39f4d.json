The album aptly displayed RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well-rounded guitar prowess and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbeyond-his-yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ songwriting. However, just three short years later, McGarvey got his first big break when he was chosen by Eric Clapton himself to perform at his 2010 Crossroads Festival. Since then, he has relentlessly hit the road across the US, (as well as 3 successful European tours) building a loyal following the old-fashioned way, all the while honing his craft and molding his own signature sound.\nWhich brings us to his much-anticipated follow-up release Ã¢â‚¬Å“RedefinedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Whether a conscious decision or not, the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 11 tracks give the impression that McGarvey is uninterested in following in anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s footsteps, nor will he bend to appease blues purists. No clichÃƒÂ©d I-IV-V progressions, no cover tunes, pretty much nothing youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect to find on a post-SRV blues rock artists album. While there are plenty of stellar artists currently populating the blues rock genre, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an over-abundance of acts whose sole purpose seems to be throwing together uninspired songs as a vehicle to showcase how many licks they can cram into a 12 bar solo. While McGarvey has astounding technique and chops to spare, his playing never comes across as over indulgent, nor do the songs feel like platforms for six string wankery. The fact that Ryan is just 25 years old makes this trait all the more remarkable.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ryanmcgarvey.com/music&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ryanmcgarvey.com/music&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e5d953d6a38beb5521ba811c7c5755aac39f4d","amp;dn":"Ryan+McGarvey+-+Redefined","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e5d953d6a38beb5521ba811c7c5755aac39f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,229,217,83,214,163,139,235,85,33,186,129,28,124,87,85,170,195,159,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
