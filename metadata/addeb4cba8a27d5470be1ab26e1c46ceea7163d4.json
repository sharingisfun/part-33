The text begins with the fundamental principles of textiles, including the origins of fabric architecture, then progressing to a discussion of the modern textiles of today. It covers relevant textile materials and their properties, including coatings and membranes. In addition, a range of design considerations are discussed, with detailed information on installation and failure modes. A series of case studies from around the world accompany the discussion, illustrating the applications of textiles in architecture.\n\nOffers key coverage of the fundamental principles, from the origins of fabric architecture to modern textile\nProvides analysis of relevant textile materials and their properties, including coatings and membranes\nContains expert insights in to the applications of textiles in architecture, presenting a series of relevant case-studies from around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:addeb4cba8a27d5470be1ab26e1c46ceea7163d4","amp;dn":"Fabric+Structures+in+Architecture+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"addeb4cba8a27d5470be1ab26e1c46ceea7163d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,222,180,203,168,162,125,84,112,190,26,178,110,28,70,206,234,113,99,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
