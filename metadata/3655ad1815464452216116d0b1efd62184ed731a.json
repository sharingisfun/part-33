Music of the feature film is directed by Dilip Sarkar. The story of ancient history when the foreign forces first laid siege on our country dates back to Vasco Da Gama. They wanted to trade with us and thereby with time they ended up robbing us of our independence. Many revolts took place in different parts of the country. One of the prominent of them has to be the armory raid which took place on 18th april 1930 led by Surya Sen, fondly remembered by us till today as Master da. He gave up his life fighting for the country. He was a dynamic personality and believed that the youth of the country had the power to bring about a change in the country's pitiable situation. He trained young men and thought way ahead of his time. He trained women as well in a time when they were not even allowed education. Aftermath of the raid was however brutal as he was always on the move or in hiding after this. Finally he was caught after being betrayed by one of his own man, Netra Sen in 1933. Surya Sen was imprisoned and therefore hanged till death. The entire country mourned the death of a man, who will be remembered and respected by all forever.\n\nThe Patriotic Bengali Film Chattogram Astragar Lunthan was released in the year 1980 starring Bhoben Majumdar, Dipti Roy, Amar Chatterjee, Banani Choudury, Smriti Rekha Biswas, Kalpana Roy, Dipak Mukherjee &amp; others.
