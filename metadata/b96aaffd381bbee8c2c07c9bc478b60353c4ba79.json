For every song Joseph Arthur has released, he's probably kept three others in the vault for safekeeping. Indeed, Arthur has been known to start working on a new album - or two - while simultaneously trying to finish another. It was amid this abundance of riches that the Brooklyn-by way of Ohio-native began molding a collection of music under a single narrative thread: 'The Ballad of Boogie Christ', is described by Arthur as &quot;a fictionalized character loosely based on my own journey.&quot; Encompassing sessions put to tape in upstate New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Arthur's own Brooklyn studio, the 24-song double album showcases the artist's signature rich storytelling set to a diverse range of rock'n'roll. &quot;The Ballad of Boogie Christ is unlike anything I've ever done before. It's a big production featuring horns and brass and living legends like Garth Hudson, Ben Harper, Jim Keltner, Joan Wasser and many othersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.It's a concept album with a\nstory arc about a man falling apart and coming back together in insanity and enlightenment. It's a psychedelic soul record about redemption and what happens when you find it and lose it. It all came from words and poems like seeds that bloomed into songs which themselves fathered some of the richest music I've made in 17 years of putting together records. I can't wait for you to hear it. This is the one I've been waiting for years to put out.&quot;\n\n\n\nCOVERS\n-------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/YV0z&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/YV0z&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¢\n\nCD 1\n----------\n01.
