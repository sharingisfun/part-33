Also, it was in one big chunk of a file, so I split it and recoded it. Gained in size (which is bad), gained in comfort (which is good).                \n\nSorry, the previous torrent was kinda bad, the ordering of files was wrong.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a7301955b2980ee9b12070e81f248bce5a760b","amp;dn":"Jan+Garbarek-1974-Luminessence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a7301955b2980ee9b12070e81f248bce5a760b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,167,48,25,85,178,152,14,233,177,32,112,232,31,36,139,206,90,118,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
