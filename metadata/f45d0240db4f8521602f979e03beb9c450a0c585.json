The radicals from Winnipeg, Canada, got together in 1989 and eventually played a show with NOFX. After talking with Fat Mike and realizing they shared the same D.I.Y. attitude, the band agreed to join his fledgling label. Ideally, the band would have loved to skirt the entire capitalist process of selling and marketing music, but made compromises in order to get its pro-gay, pro-feminist, pro-civil liberties, anti-fascism message out. Screeching over fast, catchy punk music, the group moved easily from humorous to profound to blunt with song titles like &quot;I Was a Pre-Teen McCarthyist,&quot; &quot;Hate, Myth, Muscle, Etiquette,&quot; and &quot;Stick That Fucking Flag Up Your Goddamn Ass, You Skinhead Creep.&quot;\n\nThat style took a dramatic turn in 1997 when singer, songwriter, and bassist John K. Samson left to write, start a publishing company, and eventually form the Weakerthans. The remaining members of Propagandhi started their own label, G7 Welcoming Committee, which released the band&amp;#039;s third album, Where Quantity Is Job #1, along with Weakerthans&amp;#039; records and Propagandhi&amp;#039;s 2001 effort, Today&amp;#039;s Empire, Tomorrow&amp;#039;s Ashes, in Canada. Founding member and guitarist/vocalist Chris Hannah left the group in 2003, leaving Jordy Samolesky and Todd Kowalski to the difficult task of finding a replacement. They eventually settled on Portage Terriers vocalist Glenn Lambert and quickly headed into the studio. Both Where Quantity Is Job #1 -- a compilation of live tracks, demos, and previously unreleased material -- and Potemkin City Limits were released in 2005. \n\n[b]Tracks:[/b]\n\n1\tMutual Friend   \t\t\n2\tIntro   \t00:32  \t\n3\tNation States   \t02:20  \t\n4\tWde Is Me   \t01:29  \t\n5\tOka Everywhere   \t\t\n6\tHaille Does   \t00:35  \t\n7\tHebron (Reggae Fiesta!)   \t03:35  \t\n8\tRemain   \t01:30  \t\n9\tJust Between   \t02:06  \t\n10\tFriends   \t01:27  \t\n11\tNo Exchange   \t00:29  \t\n12\tT.I.Y.   \t01:07  \t\n13\tDigging a Grave   \t00:36  \t\n14\tBecause They Don&amp;#039;t Speak for Themselves, Fucker   \t02:17  \t\n15\t60 Billion Served   \t04:00  \t\n16\tAppliances and Cars   \t03:04  \t \n\n[b]Rating (of 10):[/b]\n\n7\n\n[b]Release Date:[/b]\n\n1995\n\n[b]Label:[/b]\n\nRecess\n\n[b]Genre:[/b]\n\n* Rock\n\n[b]Styles:[/b]\n\n* Punk Rock\n\n[b]Bitrate:[/b]\n\n128kbps\n\n[b]File format:[/b]\n\nmp3\n\n[b]File size:[/b]\n\n26.1 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f45d0240db4f8521602f979e03beb9c450a0c585","amp;dn":"Propagandhi+-+1995+-+I%5C%27d+Rather+Be+Flag+Burning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f45d0240db4f8521602f979e03beb9c450a0c585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,93,2,64,219,79,133,33,96,47,151,158,3,190,185,196,80,160,197,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
