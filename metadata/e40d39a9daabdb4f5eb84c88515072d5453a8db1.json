Martinez, &quot;Future Bright: A Transforming Vision of Human Intelligence&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 0199781842 | 2013 | EPUB | 320 pages | 2,1 MB\n\nEver since Alfred Binet invented the first IQ test more than a century ago, we have thought of intelligence as fixed from birth and unalterable-as genetically programmed and immutable as eye color. If our IQ was 115 at the age of eighteen, it would be 115 at age thirty-two and at age seventy-two. But as Michael Martinez reveals in Future Bright, human intelligence is not at all a static quality. Drawing on cutting-edge research, Martinez shows that not only can we improve our IQ scores--with the right approach, we can improve intelligence itself.
