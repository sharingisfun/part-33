The game is a crossover between the PokÃƒÂ©mon and Nobunaga's Ambition video game series. The game was released in Japan on 17th March 2012, in North America on June 18, 2012 and in Europe (partly, i.e. in UK, Italy and Benelux) on 27th July 2012.\n\n\nGameplay\n========\nThe player, accompanied by an Eevee, travels throughout the Ransei Region  befriending PokÃƒÂ©mon and battling Warriors  and Warlords  to conquer the region and unite it as one nation; Warlords and Warlord Leaders can join the player's party, allowing the player access to more PokÃƒÂ©mon. The gameplay is turn-based strategy and is a tactical RPG rather than the typical main PokÃƒÂ©mon games, with different PokÃƒÂ©mon being capable of different attacks and means of movement. Warlords also have unique battle-changing powers that boost their PokÃƒÂ©mon's powers. The various Warlords and Warlord Leaders are named after figures in Japanese history, with the game's Nobunaga being a take on the real Oda Nobunaga. After beating Nobunaga and the main story line, players are able to take on 32 special episodes, each featuring one of the other warlords and having different objectives (such as taking over a portion of Ransei rather than the whole region). They feature smarter AI (with the opposing nations attacking your countries more often), the ability to upgrade the locations within the regions through a bank to find more Pokemon or get better items, and the ability to evolve the rest of the Warlords. After the episodes of the 16 senior warlords are completed, a final episode will be unlocked. It is essentially a new game with the main playable character with all the added features of the post-game episodes.\n\n+++++++++++++++\n+Install Notes+\n+++++++++++++++\n1.
