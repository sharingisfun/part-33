The album consists of a selection of pieces by Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, and Handel as well as Bach whose music was exclusively featured on the first album. The title of The Well-Tempered Synthesizer is a play on Bach\\'s own collection of pieces entitled The Well-Tempered Clavier.\n\nAll selections were performed on a Moog modular synthesizer system. Like Switched On Bach, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer was recorded on an 8 track Ampex tape recorder using numerous takes and overdubs. This was long before the days of MIDI sequencers and recording the album was by all accounts a laborious process.\n\nAbout Carlos\\'s rendition of Brandenburg Concerto No. 4, renowned Canadian concert pianist Glenn Gould had the following to say: Carlos\\'s realization of the Fourth Brandenburg Concerto is, to put it bluntly, the finest performance of any of the Brandenburgs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ live, canned, or intuited ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I\\'ve ever heard.\n\nI have ripped this from CD using winamp at a relatively high bitrate. As far as I am aware the quality is near as dammit faultless although it\\'s been along time since i last had time to listen to the whole thinag all the way through.\n\nI first heard this 33 years ago on an LP. The quality of the original recording was amazing then. It has lost nothing in translation from Vinyl to CD.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403df3ecce3b4ab77e262e5e6ffd8efa365c36a5","amp;dn":"Wendy+Carlos+-+The+Well+Tempered+Synthesizer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403df3ecce3b4ab77e262e5e6ffd8efa365c36a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,61,243,236,206,59,74,183,126,38,46,94,111,253,142,250,54,92,54,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
