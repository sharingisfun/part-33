The game is the fourth installment to the Devil May Cry series.\n\nIn the game, the player controls both Nero and Dante, the game's protagonist and the series' title character as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons. The characters Lady and Trish from previous games in the series makes an appearance, along with new characters Nero, Kyrie, Credo, Gloria, and Agnus. The game is set after Devil May Cry but before Devil May Cry 2.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews, receiving an average 82% over three consoles from Metacritic (84% on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and 78% on the PC). GameSpy gave it 4 stars out of 5, stating that &quot;DMC4 succeeds on many levels because it fuses fan service with entertaining gameplay&quot;, finding that &quot;visually, DMC4 is a dynamo.&quot;\n\nIt spawned a handheld version, Devil May Cry 4: Refrain, that was released on iOS.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGameplay in Devil May Cry 4 is similar to previous games in the series. The player must fight through levels called &quot;missions&quot;, occasionally solving puzzles or gathering items. Performance in a mission is graded from D being the bottom grade through C, B, A, and S being the highest grade. Grades are based on items used, Red Orbs gathered, time taken, and the amount of Style Points accumulated. Each Style Point grade has its own tag-word. The stylish grade shows up on the side of the screen and starts at &quot;Deadly&quot;(D); progresses through &quot;Carnage&quot;(C), &quot;Brutal&quot;(B), and &quot;Atomic&quot;(A); then, progresses through one last bar of grade containing the phrases &quot;Smokin'&quot;(S), &quot;Smokin' Style&quot;(SS), and lastly &quot;Smokin' Sick Style&quot;(SSS). Stylish combat is the main focus of the game, which is conveyed through unbroken combos of varied attacks while avoiding damage. The player must avoid enemy attacks to continue performing combos, often by memorizing attack patterns.[2]\n\nThe Devil Trigger is a super state that enables the player to become more powerful adding a slow but steady health regeneration, with increased damage done. Devil Trigger can be activated by pressing the button to trigger it when the minimum amount on the gauge is filled or when the player is near death during combat, and also through items called Devil Stars.[2]\n\n \nDante performing one of his signature moves, the Stinger attackSome changes introduced into Devil May Cry 4 are the presence of two playable characters, Dante and Nero, and a slight modification to the shop system. A new currency, Proud Souls, is used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls are rewarded at the end of missions and the amount varies depending on how well the player performed. Cost of abilities also increase with the purchase of other abilities, though all abilities can be sold back for the original price.[2]\n\nThe player plays as Nero throughout most of the game. He starts and ends the game with his Red Queen sword, Blue Rose revolver, and the powers of his Devil Bringer (his demonic right arm). The Red Queen features an Exceed Gauge that can be charged up, allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes, until the gauge empties. The Exceed Gauge can also be filled by pressing the rev button at the peak of each slash, which allows for more powerful combos capable of breaking the opponent's guard. Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer, and can use it to pull himself towards enemies or vice-versa. The Devil Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's Devil Bringer also gains new abilities during the course of the game, such as being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs. Nero eventually gains the ability to use Devil Trigger after getting the katana known as Yamato, which increases his Devil Bringer's power, thus changing his Devil Bringer attacks into more powerful versions with different animations.[2]\n\nThe player plays as Dante through seven missions, taking over halfway through the game. His gameplay is similar to that of Devil May Cry 3, with him having access to multiple melee and ranged weapons which he gains after boss battles, and being able to cycle through them freely in combat, being no longer limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game. Dante also starts with his four styles (Trickster, Royal Guard, Sword Master, Gunslinger), each of which grants him different abilities, but he may now switch them at will with buttons or pads on the PlayStation 3 controller or the Xbox 360 controller, unlike in Devil May Cry 3. He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his appearance, which only has one style level and can be accessed by pressing a direction button twice. Styles do not level up through experience as in the previous game, but must instead be upgraded in the shop screen in between missions or at statues. Dante can also enter Devil Trigger; in his Devil Trigger he gains most of the benefits that Nero's Devil Trigger has, though, as he does not have the Devil Bringer, he gets animation and property changes on some of his normal attacks instead.[2]\n\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nWindows XP / Vista[1]\nIntel Pentium 4 or Core 2 Duo processor\n1 GB RAM\nGeForce 6600 with 256 MB VRAM\n8 GB HDD space\n\nAFTER INSTALLATION.....................\n\nSTART .EXE FILE TO PLAY.\n\nENJOY.......................AND PLZ SEED................UPLOADED BY AMIR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea6cb4a479dfa90ea4112a8bf18655eeab8da68","amp;dn":"Devil+May+Cry+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fea6cb4a479dfa90ea4112a8bf18655eeab8da68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,166,203,74,71,157,250,144,234,65,18,168,191,24,101,94,234,184,218,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
