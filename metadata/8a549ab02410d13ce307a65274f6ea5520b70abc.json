Flay played for something called &quot;Stanford Sessions&quot; on May 25th, 2006. She got into music while a student at Stanford, so it makes sense.\nTranscribed from YT videos to 128kbps. Sound quality is quite clear\nThe videos had several seconds of silence at the beginning and end of the videos; I edited those out but otherwise left the files untouched.\n\nK. Flay (real name Kristine Flaherty) provided rapping/vocals only, but there was accompaniment on drum (named sounded like &quot;Laurie Anderson&quot;) and guitar (name sounded like &quot;Ryan Noreigna&quot;)\n\nArtist tag K. Flay\nDate tag 2006\nalbum tag 2006.05.25 - Stanford Sessions [YYYY.MM.DD is a system I use for other live recordings as well, so as to make them easily sortable by performance date.]\t\n\n\nI have lots of other K. Flay stuff (including standard/studio versions of many of the songs from here).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a549ab02410d13ce307a65274f6ea5520b70abc","amp;dn":"K.Flay+Live+-+Stanford+Sessions+-+May+25th+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a549ab02410d13ce307a65274f6ea5520b70abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,84,154,176,36,16,209,60,227,7,166,82,116,246,234,85,32,183,10,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
