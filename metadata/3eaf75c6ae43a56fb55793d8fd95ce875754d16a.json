Now, for the first time, programmers have an alternative that doesn't add an extra layer of abstraction or require plugins. CoffeeScript provides all of JavaScript's functionality wrapped in a cleaner, more succinct syntax that encourages use of &quot;the good parts&quot; of the language.\n\nCoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development is aimed at programmers who want to get a grip on this new language while improving their understanding of JavaScript. You'll learn about time-saving features like list comprehensions and splats, organize your code into modules with extensible classes, and get your feet wet with jQuery by building a fast-paced word game.\n\nThe book also introduces Node.js, the foremost server-side JavaScript environment. Node and CoffeeScript turn out to be a great match, allowing you to develop the front and back ends of a web application in the same language. With CoffeeScript in your toolkit, you can write great code anywhere.\n\nFiletype: pdf\nNumber of pages: 154\nISBN-10: 1934356786\nISBN-13: 978-1934356784","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eaf75c6ae43a56fb55793d8fd95ce875754d16a","amp;dn":"Pragmatic.CoffeeScript.Jul.2011.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eaf75c6ae43a56fb55793d8fd95ce875754d16a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,175,117,198,174,67,165,111,181,87,147,216,253,149,206,135,87,84,209,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
