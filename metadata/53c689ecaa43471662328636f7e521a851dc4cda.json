And yet mysteries remain: What was really going on in her brief, impulsive marriages to Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton, and what is going on in her partnership with Brad Pitt? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind the oft-reported feud with her father, the Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight?  What drove her to become a mother of six children in six years? AndÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps most puzzling of allÃ¢â‚¬â€what about the other side of Angelina: How did this talented but troubled young actress, barely 35 years old, become a respected Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations as well as the &quot;most powerful celebrity in the world&quot; (unseating Oprah Winfrey) on ForbesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 2009 Celebrity 100 list? \n\nThe answers that Andrew Morton has uncovered are astonishing, taking us deep inside AngelinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world to show us what shaped her as a child, as an actress, and as a woman struggling to overcome personal demons that have never before been revealed. In this spellbinding biography, Andrew Morton draws upon far-reaching original interviews and research, accompanied by exclusive private photographs, to show us the true story behind both the wild excesses of AngelinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s youth and her remarkable work with children and victims of poverty and disaster today.\n\n**\n\nReview\n\n&quot;If there is a celebrity today who merits the spadework of an unauthorized Morton biography, it's Jolie, with a potential audience that includes just about anyone who has gone through a supermarket checkout line in the last decade, glanced at tabloid headlines about Angelina, say, open- mouth kissing her brother or swapping vials of blood with Billy Bob Thornton and wondered: &quot;What was she thinking?&quot;\n\nIf there's anyone to blame here, according to this book, it's the parents, since the bitter relationship between actor Jon Voight and Marcia Lynne (later Marcheline) Bertrand runs as a subplot throughout. Her father left Bertrand for another woman when Angelina was 2, and her mother/manager is portrayed as vacillating between being a laissez-faire hippie mother and a pushy sort of stage mom who, according to Morton, tried Ã¢â‚¬â€ among other things Ã¢â‚¬â€ to push her daughter into a relationship with Mick Jagger.\n\nIt's at this point [after Jolie and Brad Pitt come together] that the book seems to move into hyperdrive, with endless rounds of globe-trotting, location shooting, child-acquiring and philanthropic efforts. But the faster it seems to move, the harder it is to put down. Maybe that's because, like salt, we have a craving for explanation, for back story, and Morton's book offers a satisfying dose of both. While the healthier approach might be to limit the intake by vowing to pick it up occasionally and flip to the index for a snippet like: &quot;Haven, JamesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦relationship with&quot; or &quot;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,&quot; that's not likely to happen.\n\nChances are you won't be able to put this book down until your mouth is dry and your blood pressure is racing.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Los Angeles Times\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAndrew Morton is one of the world's best-known biographers and a leading authority on modern celebrity.
