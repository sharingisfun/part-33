The EP contained 3 tracks of up to 15 minutes in length, and was largely hailed by the Oxford music press.\n\nFollowing &quot;Threat Level&quot; was their most uncompromising outing to date, the &quot;All The Good Titles Were Taken By Bad Songs&quot; EP, which featured 4 songs further exploring the extremes of calculated, crushing heaviness and sublime ambience.\n\nAfter a successful tour in 2007 the band recorded but never released 4 original songs and a remixed track on the working title EP only know as &quot;Treading The Fine Line Between Clever And Genius&quot;.\n\nAll of the music contained within this package has been released previously but retracted from sale after line up changes in 2008, with the exception of &quot;Treading The Fine Line Between Clever And Genius&quot; which has never been released.\n\nBeing the singer from the band, i'd like to share this with the free community.
