Full Descriptionrestraints. HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR presents a definitive and immensely enjoyable answer. \n\nComprised of ex-Lonestar lead vocalist/bassist John Rich and longtime Nashville songwriter/scenester Big Kenny, Big &amp; Rich stake a claim as country music's counterpart to They Might Be Giants (or perhaps even Frank Zappa), combining a dizzying array of styles and unorthodox lyrical subject matter with gleeful abandon. Charging out of the gate with a song that borrows from Limp Bizkit and prominently features Cowboy Troy, &quot;the world's only six-foot, five-inch, 250-pound black cowboy rapper,&quot; the album careens from Jimmy Buffet-like party anthems (&quot;Big Time&quot;) to AC/DC-influenced, double-entendre-laden rockers (&quot;Save a Horse [Ride a Cowboy]&quot;). Luckily, the incredibly high caliber of musicianship and unwavering creative spirit keep the record from ever slipping into parody. Instead, Big &amp; Rich have single-handedly created a new hybrid genre that promises to inspire a host of similarly inclined free spirits. \n\nProducers: Big Kenny, John Rich, Paul Worley. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/annou&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/annou&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70c8fb558e5a13e61c9b78b3615e6ad9e5338ecf","amp;dn":"Big+%26+Rich+-+Horse+Of+A+Different+Color%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70c8fb558e5a13e61c9b78b3615e6ad9e5338ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,200,251,85,142,90,19,230,28,155,120,179,97,94,106,217,229,51,142,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
