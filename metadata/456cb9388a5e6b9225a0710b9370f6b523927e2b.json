Dex is the proprietor of Stumptown Investigations, and a fairly talented P.I. Unfortunately, she's less adept at throwing dice than solving cases. Her recent streak has left her beyond broke-she's into the Confederated Tribes of the Wind Coast for 18 large. But maybe Dex's luck is about to change. Sue-Lynne, head of the Wind Coast's casino operation, will clear Dex' debt if she can locate Sue-Lynne's missing granddaughter. But is this job Dex's way out of the hole or a shove down one much much deeper?\n\nOther works by Greg Rucka: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4135240/Queen_and_Country_1-32_(Oni__Greg_Rucka)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4135240/Queen_and_Country_1-32_(Oni__Greg_Rucka)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456cb9388a5e6b9225a0710b9370f6b523927e2b","amp;dn":"Stumptown+v1+%231-4+%282009%29+%28Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456cb9388a5e6b9225a0710b9370f6b523927e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,108,185,56,138,94,107,146,37,160,113,11,147,112,246,181,35,146,126,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
