My basket was full soon and the owner of the shop gave me this cd as a present. It's a quite  good compilation! Considering all the genres in contemporary jazz and despite the enormous possibilities offered by electronics, acousticity still lends vitality. The tone color of an acousitc guitar, piano, saxophone or naturall precussion instrument remains unparalleled. Though interesting and enduring music continues to support this logic, a workable integration of acoustics and electronic bodes well for the future of jazz. It is this thematic concept that reflects JAZZIZ Collection Volume One.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
