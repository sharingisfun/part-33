It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive\n    lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait\n    of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the\n    relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard\n    Phillips (two time Academy AwardÃ‚Â«-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate\n    captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are\n    set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target\n    Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali\n    coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their\n    control.\n   \n   \n   \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:629c1b38e1563d18c61a45b94b8620130771ef9c","amp;dn":"Captain.Phillips.2013.DVD9.WS.NTSC.DVDR-NoRBiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"629c1b38e1563d18c61a45b94b8620130771ef9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,156,27,56,225,86,61,24,198,26,69,185,75,134,32,19,7,113,239,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
