Much like Seinfeld, the subject matter in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of daily life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas, and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, as well as his annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which leads him often into awkward situations.\n\nConcept:\n\nThe series stars Larry David as an extreme fictionalized version of himself. Similar to the real-life David, the character is well-known in the entertainment industry as the co-creator and main co-writer of the highly successful sitcom Seinfeld. Throughout most of the series, the Larry David character is living a married life in Los Angeles with his wife Cheryl (played by Cheryl Hines), without children. David's main confidant on the show is his manager, Jeff Greene (played by Curb executive producer Jeff Garlin), who has a temperamental wife Susie (Susie Essman). A large portion of the show's many guest stars are various celebrities and public figures, such as actors, comedians, sportspeople and politicians, who play themselves. These include David's long-time friend Richard Lewis, as well as Ted Danson and his wife Mary Steenburgen, who all have recurring roles as fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nThe show is set and filmed in various affluent Westside communities of (and occasionally downtown) Los Angeles, California, as well as the adjacent incorporated cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica. Several episodes in the third, fourth and eighth seasons also feature New York City, Mr. David's hometown.\n\nAlthough David maintains an office, he leads a semi-retired life in the series, and is rarely shown working regularly, other than in season four, which centered on his being cast as the lead in the Mel Brooks play The Producers, and in season seven, writing a Seinfeld reunion show. Most of the series revolves around Larry's interactions with his friends and acquaintances, with Larry often at odds with the other characters (usually to Larry's detriment). Despite this, the characters do not seem to harbor ill feelings toward each other for any extended period and the cast has stayed stable throughout the show.\n\nDavid has explained the meaning of the show's title in TV interviews: It reflects his perception that many people seem to live their lives projecting false enthusiasm, which he believes is used to imply that &quot;they are better than you.&quot; This conflicts with his style, which is very droll and dry. The title also urges the audience not to expect too much from the show; at the time of the premiere, David wanted to lower expectations after the phenomenal success of Seinfeld.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=675439#pid675439&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=675439#pid675439&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t230 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t23 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t10 + 2 Teaser + 1 txt = 13\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a09704b0c1fc17fa124e00239e6c0b656f61b2c3","amp;dn":"Curb+Your+Enthusiasm+%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Season+8+Complete+HDTV+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a09704b0c1fc17fa124e00239e6c0b656f61b2c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,151,4,176,193,252,23,250,18,78,0,35,158,108,11,101,111,97,178,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
