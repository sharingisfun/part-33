Most of us get that. But what we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always understand is that God loves us just as much as He does His son. Many times in the Old Testament, God refers to human beings as His Ã¢â‚¬Å“beloved.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But when God called Jesus His beloved, Jesus did something truly remarkable: He believed Him. He lived every moment of His life fully convinced of His identity. And unlike every other person in history . . . He never forgot. \n\nIn Prototype, Jonathan Martin creates a vivid understanding of what it means to be beloved by God. To completely trust, as Jesus did, that God loves you. To live life without fear, confident in your identity and purpose. To handle lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wounds as Jesus did, and to wake every day with a deep awareness of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presence. \n\nMartin reveals a startling truth at the heart of the gospel: Jesus is our prototype. And as we discover how the knowledge of being GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beloved changed everything for JesusÃ¢â‚¬â€how it set Him free to live out his purpose and love God, others, and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€it will begin to do the same for us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a10fe64c1165901c7a6970bb865531927b82f740","amp;dn":"Prototype+-+What+Happens+When+You+Discover+You%27re+More+Like+Jesu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a10fe64c1165901c7a6970bb865531927b82f740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,15,230,76,17,101,144,28,122,105,112,187,134,85,49,146,123,130,247,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
