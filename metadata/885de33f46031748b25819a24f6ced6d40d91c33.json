The United States, EU, Turkey and neighboring states have called for Syria's president al-Assad to step down as rumors and reports of violence continue to make headlines in the corporate media. Tarpley is the author of 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA and Obama: The Postmodern Coup - Making of a Manchurian Candidate. \n\nAlex also talks with libertarian activist and businessman Mark Hinkle. He is the National Chairman of the Libertarian Party. \n\nAlex talks about a pending Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare and the dissolution of the OWS movement as the NYPD removes protesters from Zuccotti Park on Manhattan.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
