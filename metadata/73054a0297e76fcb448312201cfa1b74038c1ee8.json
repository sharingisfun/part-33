It was edited to fit that programme's schedule, and is therefore not the full documentary, which as of 11 June 2013 is unavailable.\n\nOCCULT PUNK. BITCHES.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73054a0297e76fcb448312201cfa1b74038c1ee8","amp;dn":"Britain%27s+Wicca+Man+%28ABC+Compass+version%29.WEBRIP.OccultPunk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73054a0297e76fcb448312201cfa1b74038c1ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,5,74,2,151,231,111,203,68,131,18,32,28,250,27,116,3,140,30,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
