In other words, it's a modern-day Transport Tycoon with procedural content and a sophisticated city simulation.\n\n&quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the year 1850, and there are great times ahead! Establish a transport company and be its manager. Build infrastructure such as railways and stations, purchase transportation vehicles and manage lines. Fulfill the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs and watch cities evolve dynamically.\n\nTrain Fever runs on an engine specifically developed for this game.
