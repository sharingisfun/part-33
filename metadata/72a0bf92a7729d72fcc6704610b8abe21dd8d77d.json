Both groups are bent on acquiring the technology behind sentient super-weapons developed by Redd Research, a private research and development firm. Ray Wright, TroyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unstable friend and employee of this firm, drags him into a world of corporate espionage, doomsday prophecies, and paradigm shifts that culminates with Troy at the helm of a mechanical monster. A novel from the author of the bestselling works The Camaro Murders and Lady in Flames.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a0bf92a7729d72fcc6704610b8abe21dd8d77d","amp;dn":"Power+in+the+Hands+of+One+by+Ian+Lewis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a0bf92a7729d72fcc6704610b8abe21dd8d77d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,160,191,146,167,114,157,114,252,198,112,70,16,184,171,226,29,216,215,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
