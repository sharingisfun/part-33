Updated to incorporate the recent major advances, Genomes 3 is an invaluable companion for any undergraduate throughout their studies in molecular genetics.\n\nGenomes 3 builds on the achievements of the previous two editions by putting genomes, rather than genes, at the centre of molecular genetics teaching. Recognising that molecular biology research was being driven more by genome sequencing and functional analysis than by research into genes, this approach has gathered momentum in recent years.\n\nThe latest edition of TA Brown's genomes 3.\nHigh quality PDF complete with bookmarks, table of contents etc.\n\nSeed and enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd44fdf4dc48cd289cb712dd06c6eff54307d524","amp;dn":"Genomes+3+TA+Brown+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd44fdf4dc48cd289cb712dd06c6eff54307d524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,68,253,244,220,72,205,40,156,183,18,221,6,198,239,245,67,7,213,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
