Developers will find hundreds of tried-and-true Java &quot;recipes&quot; covering all of the major APIs as well as some APIs that aren't as well documented in other Java books.\n\nThe Java Cookbook, like the bestselling Perl Cookbook, covers a lot of ground, and offers Java developers short, focused pieces of code that can be easily incorporated into other programs. The idea is to focus on things that are useful, tricky, or both. The book includes code segments covering many specialized APIs--like media and servlets--and should serve as a great &quot;jumping-off place&quot; for Java developers who want to get started in areas outside of their specialization.\n\nThe book provides quick solutions to particular problems that can be incorporated into other programs, but that aren't usually programs in and of themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62ea1f91e03f3d4433864e2c7169b032b22e25b","amp;dn":"Java+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b62ea1f91e03f3d4433864e2c7169b032b22e25b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,46,161,249,30,3,243,212,67,56,100,226,199,22,155,3,43,34,226,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
