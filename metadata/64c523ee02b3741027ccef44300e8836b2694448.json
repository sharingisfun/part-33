CentOS conforms fully with the upstream vendor's redistribution policy and aims to be 100% binary compatible. (CentOS mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.)  CentOS is free.\n\nCentOS is developed by a small but growing team of core developers.  In turn the core developers are supported by an active user community including system administrators, network administrators, enterprise users, managers, core Linux contributors and Linux enthusiasts from around the world.\n\nCentOS has numerous advantages over some of the other clone projects including:  an active and growing user community, quickly rebuilt, tested, and QA'ed errata packages, an extensive mirror network, developers who are contactable and responsive, multiple free support avenues including IRC Chat, Mailing Lists, Forums, a dynamic FAQ.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.centos.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.centos.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=centos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=centos&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64c523ee02b3741027ccef44300e8836b2694448","amp;dn":"CentOS+5.8+DVD+64-bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64c523ee02b3741027ccef44300e8836b2694448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,197,35,238,2,179,116,16,39,204,239,68,48,14,136,54,178,105,68,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
