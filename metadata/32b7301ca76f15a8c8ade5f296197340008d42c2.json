Better than the recent MP4 or the 4*cd version \n(with the strange Apocalypse Pooh bit at the end). Still not prefect of course, \nthere are still the damaged film effects here and there and the colours aren't \nnear as vivid as the official releases. But much more watchable than the \nprevious bootlegs known circulating.\nYou should own one of the original release to enjoy this. Please don't support \npiracy.\n\nfrom Tranzor: I was given this on vhs many years ago. It was from a higher up \nsource on the food chain and quite possibly one or two generations down from the \nsource that leaked it to begin with. I originally made a 3 disc dvd set. I also \ngave it a second audio track to fix some of the muffled sound the workprint had. \nThe workprint ended right during the cow slicing. I then tacked on the finished \nfilm ended but before the credits i also added the kurtz compound destruction. \nNow you have a super edition of the film running 30 mins short of 6 hours!!. I \nhad given this out via trades but never supplied it online--as I came to find \nout later: FUCK YOU to those that ended up selling this for outrageous prices \n(like SubCin)\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGenerated with Cool NFO Creator - http://fly.to/coolbeans\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32b7301ca76f15a8c8ade5f296197340008d42c2","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Now+Workprint+-+Best+Quality+%283xDVDR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32b7301ca76f15a8c8ade5f296197340008d42c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,183,48,28,167,111,21,168,200,173,229,242,150,25,115,64,0,141,66,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
