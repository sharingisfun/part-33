A copyright entry from April 1914 credits Warfield with the music, David Young with the lyrics, and Marie Lucas with the arrangement. The title of the song is given as &quot;I Ain't Got Nobody and Nobody Cares for Me&quot;. Williams's copyright entry from 1916 for the shorter title credits the composition to Williams and Dave Peyton, and the lyrics to publisher Roger Graham.\n\nMany artists had hit records with the song, starting with Marion Harris in 1916.
