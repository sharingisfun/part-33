All of the compilations' songs utilize playback gain values from Tootie's personal volume-leveling procedure, resulting in a consistent overall listening experience without the need to adjust the volume between songs. The method focuses on vocal volume.\n\nDetails:\nFormat: FLAC, level 7\nLength: 1:23:22.0911\nAverage bitrate: 866 kbps\nEmbedded CUE Sheet\n\nPlayback verified with foobar2000.\n\n\nNotes:\nProduced to be overburned to an 80-minute CD-R.\nThe use of the tracks in the compilation independently is not recommended as most tracks are intermixed in some way. Some are shortened.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3eed769f16635d4b3af030bcc1de44ab37a5e3c","amp;dn":"Tootie%27s+April+2014+Mix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3eed769f16635d4b3af030bcc1de44ab37a5e3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,238,215,105,241,102,53,212,179,175,3,11,204,29,228,74,179,122,94,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
