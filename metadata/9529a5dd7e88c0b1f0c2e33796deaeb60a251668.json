A founding member, with his brother Gregg, of the Allman Brothers Band, Duane was also active as a session musician, and as a member of the all-star Derek and the Dominos. This seven CD set, produced by Duane's daughter Galadrielle Allman and esteemed reissue producer Bill Levenson, shows the full breadth and depth of Duane's work, from early recordings (with Gregg) in bands such as The Escorts, Allman Joys and Hour Glass; to his studio work with Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Boz Scaggs, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Ronnie Hawkins and many others; to a live jam session with the Grateful Dead. The set includes several unreleased performances, many classic Allman Brothers songs, and a collector's cache of rare singles and long out-of-print album tracks. Also included are a 72 page book with essays by Scott Schindler and Galadrielle Allman, many rare photographs, a replica of Duane's guitar pick, and a Skydog sticker. Numbered, limited edition of 10,000.\n\nTracklist:\n----------\n\nDISC ONE:\n=========\n1 THE ESCORTS Turn On Your Love Light 2:33\n2 THE ESCORTS No Name Instrumental 3:13\n3 THE ESCORTS What'd I Say 4:04\n4 THE ALLMAN JOYS Spoonful 2:27\n5 THE ALLMAN JOYS Gotta Get Away 2:38\n6 THE ALLMAN JOYS Shapes Of Things 2:47\n7 THE ALLMAN JOYS Crossroads 3:32\n8 THE ALLMAN JOYS Mister, You're A Better Man Than I 4:45\n9 THE ALLMAN JOYS Lost Woman 5:23\n10 HOUR GLASS Cast Off All My Fears 3:31\n11 HOUR GLASS I've Been Trying 2:39\n12 HOUR GLASS Nothing But Tears 2:29\n13 HOUR GLASS Power Of Love 2:51\n14 HOUR GLASS Down In Texas 3:08\n15 HOUR GLASS Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) 3:01\n16 HOUR GLASS B.B.
