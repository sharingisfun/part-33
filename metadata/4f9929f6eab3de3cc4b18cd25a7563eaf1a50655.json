Commanding Red Cell, he was directed to use them to test the Navy's anti-terrorist capabilities. During the tests, Red Cell was able to infiltrate supposedly impenetrable, highly secured bases, nuclear submarines, ships and other &quot;secure areas&quot;, including the Presidential plane Air Force One. In doing so he claims to have embarrassed several superior officers, whom he accuses of involvement in his subsequent conviction for misappropriation of funds and resources under his command.\n\nRichard &quot;Dick&quot; Marcinko (born November 21, 1940), is a retired Navy SEAL commander and Vietnam veteran. He was the first Commanding Officer of SEAL Team Six and Red Cell.
