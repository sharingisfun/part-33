Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg - The Squid And The Whale), with his zombie survival guide in-hand, has only survived this long because he's so afraid of everyone and everything. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson - 2012) means to take down as many zombies as he can on his obsessional quest for Twinkies. When a chance encounter leads the two to form a partnership, little do they realise it will take them on the post-apocalyptic adventure to end them all. With mischievous female double-act Wichita and Little Rock on the scene and millions of walking dead shuffling the great expanse of the US, things are never dull in Zombieland!\n\n\nCast: Woody Harrelson\nJesse Eisenberg\nAmber Heard\nEmma Stone\n\nDirector: Ruben Fleischer\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.7\n\n\nGeneral Info:\nRelease Title: Zombieland (2009) 1080p MKV x264 DTS BluRay-SilverTorrentHD\nGenre:  Comedy | Horror  \nRelease Date: 7 October 2009 \t\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English | French | Arabic | Danish | Dutch | Finish | Hindi | Norwegian | Swedish\nTotal Size: 5.12 GiB\nDuration: 1h 27mn\nOverall Bit rate: 8353 Kbps\nSource: Blu-Ray\n\n\nVideo Specs:\nContainer and Codec: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nFormat: MKV\nBit rate: 6677 Kbps\nResolution: 1920 x 800\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\n\nAudio Specs:\nAudio Codec And Type: DTS\nBitrate: 1509 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/7057/k0b1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/7057/k0b1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img843/6716/q8e5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img843/6716/q8e5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img62/8707/qkzi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img62/8707/qkzi.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img836/3751/fp4p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img836/3751/fp4p.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082f21b8834f95755356dabff86ea60ad867acba","amp;dn":"Zombieland+%282009%29+1080p+MKV+x264+DTS+BluRay-STHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082f21b8834f95755356dabff86ea60ad867acba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,47,33,184,131,79,149,117,83,86,218,191,248,110,166,10,216,103,172,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
