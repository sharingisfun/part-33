Some highlights include the digitally generated notes moving in unison with Vinx&amp;#039;s scat vocal toward the end of &quot;Ugly Face&quot;; the intricate vocal layering heard on &quot;September&quot;; and the odd timbres that make up &quot;Perculator&quot; and &quot;Prague City Lights.&quot; The fact that all these effects were pulled off at a live show makes them all the more impressive.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s an interesting gambit: a funk/drum &amp;#039;n bass/&quot;DJ-inspired&quot; project that is actually a band, rather than an anonymous, austere presence behind turntables and tape loops. One wonders whether &quot;DJ-inspired&quot; music can be successully melded to a \nmore traditional live band concept. By making their debut a live recording, Jungle Funk intends to argue that it is possible.\nThere&amp;#039;s only one way to find out: go see them live.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a80c5a0ffb10da7ee548cec42f1eeb6127bba1","amp;dn":"+Jungle+Funk%3B+VinX%2C+Will+Calhoun%2C+Doug+Wimbish+-+Jungle+Funk+%2819","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a80c5a0ffb10da7ee548cec42f1eeb6127bba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,168,12,90,15,251,16,218,126,229,72,206,196,47,30,235,97,39,187,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
