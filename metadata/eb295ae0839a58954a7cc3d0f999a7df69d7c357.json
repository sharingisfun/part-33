After that, his troop was to attack the savage Mbangi tribe. One tough journey later, Corbet is the only survivor of the trip, the rest having died of thirst and heat. He's about to suffer the same fate as his comrades when he finds a strange pool covered with glowing vapours. He drinks from the pool and instantly gains powers and a costume. He uses his powers to kill an attacking tiger and stop a would-be world dictator, then goes on to fight crime and the Nazis. He has &quot;neonic&quot; powers which include glowing, being able to fly, and shooting bolts of energy from his hands.\n\nGolden Age Appearances \nHit Comics #1-17\nNotes Edit\nWhen DC acquired and revived characters from Quality comics, Neon the Unknown was included on a team called the Freedom Fighters who consisted of Uncle Sam, Doll Man, The Human Bomb, Black Condor, Ray, and Phantom Lady.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb295ae0839a58954a7cc3d0f999a7df69d7c357","amp;dn":"Neon+the+Unknown+collection+COMPLETE+1940","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb295ae0839a58954a7cc3d0f999a7df69d7c357","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,41,90,224,131,154,88,149,74,124,195,208,249,153,167,223,105,215,195,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
