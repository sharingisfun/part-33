Just when things are at their worst she discovers a unique sword with the power to take her revenge. Combining elements of Kill Bill, Highlander and Blade of the Immortal with the patented Luna  \nBrothers twist, The Sword will be a must read for any fan of the action, drama, or fantasy genres.\n&quot;We came up with The Sword two years ago,&quot; said artist Jonathan Luna. &quot;Every now and then it would pop into our conversations and never get out of our heads, so we knew this was a story that we had to tell.&quot;\n&quot;Jonathan and Joshua embody everything that Image Comics is about,&quot; added Image Comics' Publisher, Erik Larsen. &quot;We found them in a blind submission and through their work with us they've become industry superstars. I'm ecstatic to read their newest series.&quot;\n\n\nThanks to the original scanners !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:413fc169fa6f5d77e50f013afc8ba6a84f5aa1a1","amp;dn":"The+Sword+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"413fc169fa6f5d77e50f013afc8ba6a84f5aa1a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,63,193,105,250,111,93,119,229,15,1,58,252,139,166,168,79,90,161,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
