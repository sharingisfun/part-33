Nor do the present books on aviation meteorology provide sufficient detail on subjects such as arid climates, tropical storms and upper tropospheric winds and temperatures.\n\nThis new book concentrates on aspects of climatology that are important for modern aviation, including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, winds and regional climatic environments from around the world.\n\nAlthough the book has been written with the airline pilot in mind, it will also be an essential reference for Air Transport Pilot Licence training staff and for ATPL students. It will also be of interest to operational route planning staff and students of climatology.\n\n\n# Paperback: 296 pages\n# Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell; 1 edition (March 13, 2001)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0632052953\n# ISBN-13: 978-0632052950","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91993eb6f28acef64c9937734df59ad835f417c1","amp;dn":"Climatology+for+Airline+Pilots%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91993eb6f28acef64c9937734df59ad835f417c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,153,62,182,242,138,206,246,76,153,55,115,77,245,154,216,53,244,23,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
