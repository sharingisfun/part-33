It was supposed to be released as the second single from CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line Dion's album All the WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ A Decade of Song, on December 11, 1999.\n\n&quot;Then You Look at Me&quot; was written by James Horner and Will Jennings, who wrote for Dion her 1997 smash hit &quot;My Heart Will Go On.&quot;\n\nUnfortunately the Bicentennial Man movie, released on December 13, 1999 and starring Robin Williams, became a flop and the single was cancelled. The second reason was the fact that &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot; became a hit and was still strong on the singles charts around the world. However, &quot;Then You Look at Me&quot; was included as a B-side to the &quot;Live (for the One I Love),&quot; The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and &quot;I Want You to Need Me&quot; singles. The movie soundtrack also included the track but in slightly modified version, produced by James Horner and Simon Franglen.
