Some, however, step over that fine line between enthusiasm and obsessionÃ¢â‚¬â€and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the place from which spring the legendary car-collector stories. In Strange but True Tales of Car Collecting, Keith Martin and the staff of Sport Car Market Magazine recount the wildest car-collecting stories of all time, focusing on tales of the most eccentric and over-the-top collectors and collections. Have you heard of the fellow who squirrelled away dozens of Chevelles, Camaros, and other classic muscle cars in semi trailers? How about the president of Shakespeare fishing rods who in the 1960s sold 30 now-priceless Bugattis for a mere $85,000? The English nobleman who cut up and buried his Ferrari horde in an elaborate insurance scam? Or how about the Duesenberg abandoned in a Manhattan parking garage for decades and uncovered by Tonight Show host Jay Leno? These are just a few of the amazing stories explored in this entertaining book, a must-have title for any car enthusiast. Both car collectors and fans of outrageous classic car, muscle car, and sports car stories will find entertainment in these tales of collectors whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gone off the rails.\n\n\nBy Keith Martin, Linda Clark\nPublished by Motorbooks in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 256 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523327c889c4002fadc16ec2c00c3650744cf300","amp;dn":"Strange+but+True+Tales+of+Car+Collecting%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523327c889c4002fadc16ec2c00c3650744cf300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,51,39,200,137,196,0,47,173,193,110,194,192,12,54,80,116,76,243,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
