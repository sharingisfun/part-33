Fergie, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Mary J. Blige, Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge, Natasha Bedingfield, Keyshia Cole, Ciara, Leona Lewis, LeAnn Rimes, and Carrie Underwood got together to record ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJust Stand Up,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a song benefiting the Stand Up to Cancer campaign.\n\nBenefit singles like this normally turn out painfully corny, but I actually really enjoy this one. No one tried to have a diva sing-off, no one is trying too hard to be the star of the song. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all very well put together. Thank Babyface and LA Reid for producing a great track. Check it!\n\nThe ladies will perform the song together on the Stand Up to Cancer television special airing on NBC, CBS, and ABC September 5.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b213f1a6f28146a3a3c1236269c281b7b01d9444","amp;dn":"Stand+Up+To+Cancer+Benefit+Single+-+Just+Stand+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b213f1a6f28146a3a3c1236269c281b7b01d9444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,19,241,166,242,129,70,163,163,193,35,98,105,194,129,183,176,29,148,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
