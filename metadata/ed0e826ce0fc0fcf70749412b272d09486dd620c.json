Most of the word problem is\nalready supplied, except for a few key words and\nnumbers that have been removed and replaced with\nblanks. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to students to fill in those blanks with\nmissing nouns, verbs, and adjectivesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just as they\nwould in other word games. The difference is that\nthis game is missing some numbers as well. When\nyour students supply the missing numbers along\nwith the words, you suddenly have a wacky math\nword problem thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fun to read and solve!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed0e826ce0fc0fcf70749412b272d09486dd620c","amp;dn":"50+Fill-in+Math+Word+Problems+-+Gr+2-3.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed0e826ce0fc0fcf70749412b272d09486dd620c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,14,130,108,224,252,15,207,112,116,148,18,178,114,208,148,134,221,98,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
