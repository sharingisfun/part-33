This powerful program takes a remarkable first-hand look at China&amp;#039;s tumultuous history, examining its social, political and cultural upheaval through eyewitness accounts, rare archival film footage and insightful commentary.\n\n\n\nPart Two: The Mao Years\n\nFrom the beginning of his rule in 1949 to his death in 1976, Mao Zedong and his colleagues attempted to forge a &quot;new China&quot; from a country mired in poverty and devastated by decades of war. Yet the Mao years would bring the new Peopl&amp;#039;s Republic of China little stability. Rare interviews with Communist Party members and ordinary citizens involved with history&amp;#039;s largest political experiment, reveal the turbulence, famine, violent campaigns and purges which destroyed the lives of more than one hundred million people.\n\n\nDVDrip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3ce3dc84dd6bd8762dde23ce13ddb8def03bdeb","amp;dn":"China.A.Century.of.Revolution.Part2.DVDrip.XviD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3ce3dc84dd6bd8762dde23ce13ddb8def03bdeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,206,61,200,77,214,189,135,98,221,226,60,225,61,219,141,239,3,189,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
