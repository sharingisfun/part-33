It is a call-in and variety show hosted by Chris Gethard that airs every Wednesday night at 11:00PM on MNN and on a live stream at the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website. The Public access television show is written and produced by Noah Forman, Dru Johnston, J.D. Amato and Chris Gethard. It is directed by J.D. Amato. The show, known for its &quot;no cool kids&quot; atmosphere, has been called &quot;oddly uplifting&quot;, a &quot;cult hit,&quot; &quot;an often riveting experiment in seat-of-your-pants broadcasting,&quot; and has gained viewers from around the world. On November 20, 2013, it was announced that Comedy Central had ordered a pilot for prospective addition to their lineup.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:148612a343dff17c4fdb1be372829c1a3cf67209","amp;dn":"The+Chris+Gethard+Show+-+Episode+%23122+-+%28480p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"148612a343dff17c4fdb1be372829c1a3cf67209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,134,18,163,67,223,241,124,79,219,27,227,114,130,156,26,60,246,114,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
