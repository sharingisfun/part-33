Yet the Pythons had stored up enough respectability to be granted a large Hollywood budget for The Meaning Of Life, which earned good reviews from mainstream critics and even won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, where a stunned audience made snap comparisons to Luis BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uel and Jacques Tati. Those plaudits are unusual, given that The Meaning Of Life is the seamiest of the Python features, and represents the troupe's most uneven work since its television days. Essentially a series of dark, Python-esque sketches linked by the progression of humanity from birth to death, The Meaning Of Life finds co-directors Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam letting impressive (and oppressive) style overwhelm the nimble humor of the Python past. What saves the film are the polished performances of Jones, Gilliam, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin, all of whom had been on stage and screen for so long by that point that they were capable of leaping in and out of characters and delivering impeccably timed speeches in extended takes. Even when the jokes are overly familiarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½predicated on skewering such common Python targets as wimpy religious leaders, the pompous upper crust, and dim working-class slobsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they're still recited with confidence, and with a trained ear for the sound of human self-delusion. The new double-disc DVD of The Meaning Of Life features a comprehensive making-of documentary, as well as some amusing deleted scenes (a few of which have been reintegrated into the film) and a handful of lame new comedy pieces that are too self-deprecating and toothless to belong to the Python tradition. More substantial is the commentary track, on which Jones and Gilliam make a case for The Meaning Of Life as the group's collaborative pinnacle. From a comedy point of view, or even a &quot;comment on life&quot; point of view, they're wrong: Both Monty Python And The Holy Grail and Monty Python's Life Of Brian are insightful where The Meaning Of Life is nasty, and sidesplitting where the later film is merely amusing. But from a cinematic point of view, Jones and Gilliam may be right. On the DVD, Idle calls The Meaning Of Life &quot;a punk film,&quot; and there's an element of rage in its obsession with sexual anxiety, dismemberment, and bodily fluids. From the grisly scene of live birth in a sterile hospital, where the doctors care more about the machines than the patient, to the grotesquely obese Mr. Creosote, who binges and purges simultaneously, The Meaning Of Life is unsparing and elaborate in its vision of humanity at its foulest.\n\n[img]http://img66.imageshack.us/img66/3009/vlcsnap15199310rb0.png[/img]\n[img]http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/9107/vlcsnap15199363rj3.png[/img]\n[img]http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/1348/vlcsnap15200203tz2.png[/img]\n[img]http://img380.imageshack.us/img380/9413/vlcsnap15203364dr0.png[/img]\n[img]http://img380.imageshack.us/img380/6171/vlcsnap15205202um0.png[/img]\n[img]http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/8822/vlcsnap15206356nn2.png[/img]\n[img]http://img393.imageshack.us/img393/8093/vlcsnap15207925bo8.png[/img]\n[img]http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/895/vlcsnap15208396dp3.png[/img]\n[img]http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/2790/vlcsnap15213598nk6.png[/img]\n\n\n[url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085959[/url]\n\n\nExtras included:\n\n[b]Snipped Bits (Deleted Scenes)[/b]\nMartin Luther\nAn Expert\nThe Cheese Lady\nRandy in the Jungle\nThe Hendys\nMr. Creosote Arrives at the Restaurant\nGaston Takes Us for a Good Walk\n\n\n[b]The School of Life[/b]\nThe Meaning of Making the Meaning of Life (this is the main extra)\nEducation Tips\nUn film de John Cleese\nRemastering a Masterpiece\n\n\n[b]Show Biz[/b]\n\nSong and Dance\nSongs Unsung - includes Christmas in Heaven, Every Sperm Is Sacred, It's The Meaning of Life\nSelling The Meaning of life - includes Rejects (rejected posters), &quot;Telepathy&quot;, Trailer and TV Spots, UK Radio and US Promotion\n\n\n[b]Fish[/b]\n\nVirtual Reunion\nWhat Fish Think\n\n\nSource: PAL DVD9 x 2 discs \nFile Name .........................................: The.Meaning.of.Life.(Director's.Cut.2003).2Audio.DVDRip.XviD-OwL.avi \nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,865,106,744 bytes \nRuntime ............................................: 1:51:42 \n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nFrame Size ......................................: 704x384 (AR: 1.833) \nFPS .................................................: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1699 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.251 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], [] \n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz \nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR \nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2 \n\nAudio 1: AC3 5.1 384kbps \nAudio 2: MP3 128 kbps stereo \n\n---- \n\nFile Name .........................................: The Meaning of Making the Meaning of Life.avi \nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 545,934,490 bytes \nRuntime ............................................: 49:00.040 \n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nFrame Size ......................................: 640x368 (AR: 1.739) \nFPS .................................................: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1283 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.218 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], [] \n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz \nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR \nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27ac056f2a3896dee0daa053bb053bc54309dbe","amp;dn":"Monty+Python%5C%27s+The+Meaning+of+Life+1983+%28Director%5C%27s+Cut+%2B+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27ac056f2a3896dee0daa053bb053bc54309dbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,122,192,86,242,163,137,109,238,13,170,5,59,176,83,188,84,48,157,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
