Corcoran\n\n- ISBN 978-953-307-368-2, Hard cover, 328 pages\n- Publisher: InTech\n- Publication date: July 2011\n- Subject: Pattern recognition\n\nAs a baby one of our earliest stimuli is that of human faces. We rapidly learn to identify, characterize and eventually distinguish those who are near and dear to us. We accept face recognition later as an everyday ability. We realize the complexity of the underlying problem only when we attempt to duplicate this skill in a computer vision system. This book is arranged around a number of clustered themes covering different aspects of face recognition. The first section on Statistical Face Models and Classifiers presents reviews and refinements of some well-known statistical models. The next section presents two articles exploring the use of Infrared imaging techniques and is followed by few articles devoted to refinements of classical methods. New approaches to improve the robustness of face analysis techniques are followed by two articles dealing with real-time challenges in video sequences. A final article explores human perceptual issues of face recognition.\n\n\n\n\nHASH: C49C468AAB93C2EA5B5685BB91D9FE1491365DA2\n\n\n\nscanned with Kaspersky  + SuperAntiSpyware + Malwarebytes = Malware FREE\n\nENJOY\n       scuba-doo\n\n\nshare the wealth and seed, comments are more then welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8253af7b4327bc9f2adc353a07b7dc49f2464b38","amp;dn":"Reviews%2C+Refinements+and+new+Ideas+in+Face+Recognition+%28scuba-do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8253af7b4327bc9f2adc353a07b7dc49f2464b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,83,175,123,67,39,188,159,42,220,53,58,7,183,220,73,242,70,75,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
