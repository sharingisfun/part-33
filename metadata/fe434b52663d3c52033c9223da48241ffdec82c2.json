But not all. Since this is the best kind of entertainment where you can learn a lot and get to know new worlds and visions, I wanted to have those talks portable on my mp3 player and converted the videos to audio only. This works for about 90% of the talks which don't need the visuals.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe434b52663d3c52033c9223da48241ffdec82c2","amp;dn":"allTalks.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe434b52663d3c52033c9223da48241ffdec82c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,67,75,82,102,61,60,82,3,60,146,35,218,72,36,31,253,236,130,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
