Working in a meat factory in Philadelphia for a pittance, he also earns extra cash as a debt collector. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a &quot;nobody&quot; to become a &quot;somebody&quot;. The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time.\n\n\nSylvester Stallone\t ....\tRocky Balboa\n\nTalia Shire\t ....\tAdrianna &quot;Adrian&quot; Pennino\n\nBurt Young\t ....\tPaulie\n\nCarl Weathers\t ....\tApollo Creed\n\tBurgess Meredith\t ....\tMickey Goldmill\n\tThayer David\t ....\tJergens\n\tJoe Spinell\t ....\tGazzo\n\tJimmy Gambina\t ....\tMike\n\tBill Baldwin\t ....\tFight Announcer (as Bill Baldwin)\n\tAl Silvani\t ....\tCut Man (as Al Salvani)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df9b3474022265c36bc4db78ce24a36c31e90b1e","amp;dn":"Rocky+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df9b3474022265c36bc4db78ce24a36c31e90b1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,155,52,116,2,34,101,195,107,196,219,120,206,36,163,108,49,233,11,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
