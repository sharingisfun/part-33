This version features all of the deleted and alternate scenes from the latest DVD version of Apocalypse Now, but goes far beyond just that. While the original, theatrical version of the movie ran 153 minutes, and the Apocalypse Now: Redux special edition DVD runs 202 minutes, this workprint runs 330 minutes, which is five and a half hours. It literally has hours of footage that never made it into the final cut. It also has temporary music (most from The Doors throughout the movie) and some unfinished special effects. \nEncoded it to FOUR 700mb parts to preserve as much quality as I could.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d2f24f73fc233fc88269de6592fd43a2dac09d","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Now+-+330+minute+workprint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d2f24f73fc233fc88269de6592fd43a2dac09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,210,242,79,115,252,35,63,200,130,105,222,101,146,253,67,162,218,192,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
