This course examines issues concerning poverty, the environment, technology, health care, gender, education and activism to helps us understand better how to initiate positive change.\n\nHow to Change the World has its origins in the Social Good Summit held at the 92nd Street Y in New York. The summit brought together some of the world's most creative entrepreneurs, writers, academics and political leaders to discuss ways innovative thinking and technology can address pressing global challenges.  Beginning from talks, panels and conversations from the summit, we will add lectures, on-line discussion groups, hangouts and readings to explore the issues in politics, technology and the environment in broader academic and historical contexts. We will then discover together what actions we can take to make a difference.\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/changetheworld","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b105a23fec57df5e4992b4c74bb5ca3a8df026de","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+How+to+Change+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b105a23fec57df5e4992b4c74bb5ca3a8df026de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,5,162,63,236,87,223,94,73,146,180,199,75,181,202,58,141,240,38,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
