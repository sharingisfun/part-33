This Crossed: DOA webcomic by Ennis ties into webisodes and will expand and further develop the concepts of the film series and characters. We are using the strengths of each medium to work together in creating a Crossed multi-platform saga which is 100% GarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision. We hope it will deliver the terror of Crossed in a whole new way and allow Garth the complete control of the filmed material to really deliver his true vision of horror","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1636168cba4500d87f6fb6e883532eb0a82f386f","amp;dn":"Crossed+Dead+or+Alive+Issue+01+Part+1+and+Intro+Video+-emidius-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1636168cba4500d87f6fb6e883532eb0a82f386f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,54,22,140,186,69,0,216,127,111,182,232,131,83,46,176,168,47,56,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
