In The Gates of Janus, Ian Brady himself allows us a glimpse into the mind of a murderer as he analyzes a dozen other serial crimes and killers.\r\n\r\nCriminal profiling by a criminal was not invented by the dramatists of Dexter.\r\n\r\nNovelist and true-crime writer Colin Wilson, author of the famous and influential book The Outsider, remarks in his introduction to Brady's book that one must first explore the depraved reaches of human consciousness to truly understand human character.\r\n\r\nWhen first released in 2001, The Gates of Janus sparked controversy attended by a huge media splash. The new edition, the first in paperback, provides the reader with a decade and a half of updates, including Brady's letters to the publisher, both providing information regarding his own demented history along with demands that Feral House remove its unflattering afterword written by author Peter Sotos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad2c6f1be56abc3734f7234aa9af3a37615e9708","amp;dn":"The+Gates+of+Janus+%28Expanded+Ed%29+%28Ian+Brady%29+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad2c6f1be56abc3734f7234aa9af3a37615e9708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,44,111,27,229,106,188,55,52,247,35,74,169,175,58,55,97,94,151,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
