Heir to the Colony of Camulod, born with Roman heritage as well as the blood of the Hibernians and the Celts, Arthur is the living incarnation of the sacred dream of his ancestors: independent survival in Britain amidst the ruins of the Roman Empire.\n\nWhen Arthur is adopted by Merlyn Britannicus, an enormous responsibility is placed on Merlyn's shoulders. Now he must prepare young Arthur to unify the clans of Britain and guard the mighty sword Excalibur.\n\nAnd, above all, Merlyn must see that Arthur survives to achieve the rest of his ancestors' dreams, in spite of the deadly threats rumbling from the Saxon Shore.\n\nÃ‚Â©1998 Jack Whyte; (P)2013 \nProduct Details\nListening Length: 36 hours and 34 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Audible, Inc.\nRelease Date: August 20, 2013\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a921af88f6b8cc4ffc5c879c52a81091432eba8f","amp;dn":"The+Saxon+Shore+-+Book+4+%5BAudioBook%5D+-+sum1_here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a921af88f6b8cc4ffc5c879c52a81091432eba8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,33,175,136,246,184,204,79,252,92,135,156,82,168,16,145,67,46,186,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
