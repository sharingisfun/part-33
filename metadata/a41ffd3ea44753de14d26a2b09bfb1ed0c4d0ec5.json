The firm sends Zappa across the near-future earth, where space tourism and cybernetics are no longer unusual, and where Zappa is tasked with executing a series of criminals.\n\nSuda has described Killer Is Dead as, &quot;the story of a man who doesn't show himself much in the public world but still worms his way into society and mercilessly eliminates the evil dispersed in it. It's a personal story, not one that's conscious of the chaos going on in the real world at the moment, but you might get more than a taste of that in the end anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENRE.....: Action\nORiGiN....: JPN/NTSC\nREGION....: NTSC/J ONLY\niMAGE.....: ISO\nSOURCE....: XGD3\nPLATFORM..: XBOX360\nRLS DATE..: 2013/07/30\nSHOP DATE.: 2013/08/01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41ffd3ea44753de14d26a2b09bfb1ed0c4d0ec5","amp;dn":"Killer+Is+Dead+JPN+XBOX360","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41ffd3ea44753de14d26a2b09bfb1ed0c4d0ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,31,253,62,164,71,83,222,20,210,106,43,9,191,177,237,12,77,14,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
