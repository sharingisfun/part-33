Barrett left behind an estate that's been valued at over $3.3 million, according to documents which were released a few days ago in the U.K. Barrett's will divided the money among his siblings, with his brother Alan getting more than $825,000, while his sisters Rosemary and Ruth and another brother named Donald each got over a half million dollars.\n\nRosemary -- who cared for Syd in the later part of his life -- was also given the money from the sale of Syd's house and an auction of his belongings, which totaled up to almost $850,000.\n\nSyd Barrett had been a co-founder of Pink Floyd in the mid-1960s. He was the band's original songwriter and lead singer, contributing to two albums before overuse of drugs led him to his departure from the group. He maintained a brief solo career before slipping from public view, staying at his Cambridge home and becoming a recluse and an artist. He died July 7th, at the age of 60.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2cb9de8b8dc4a24296e7217f48cb8e9ae9dac97","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+Psychedelic+Games+for+May","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2cb9de8b8dc4a24296e7217f48cb8e9ae9dac97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,203,157,232,184,220,74,36,41,110,114,23,244,140,184,233,174,157,172,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
