What many may not realize is how much he was also a man of ideas. Despite the most meager of formal educations, LincolnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tremendous intellectual curiosity drove him into the circle of Enlightenment philosophy and democratic political ideology. And from these, Lincoln developed a set of political convictions that guided him throughout his life and his presidency. Abraham Lincoln as a Man of Ideas, a compilation of ten essays from Lincoln scholar, Allen C. Guelzo, uncovers the hidden sources of LincolnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ideas and examines the beliefs that directed his career and brought an end to slavery and the Civil War.\n\nThese essays reveal Lincoln to be a man of impressive intellectual probity and depth as well as a man of great contradictions. He was an apostle of freedom who did not believe in human free will; a champion of the Constitution who had to step outside of it in order to save it; a man of many acquaintances and admirers, but few friends; a man who opposed slavery but also opposed the abolition of it; a man of prudence who took more political risks than any other president.\n\nGuelzo explores the many faces of LincolnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ideas, and especially the influence of the Founding Fathers and the great European champions of democracy. And he links the 16th presidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s struggles with the issues of race, emancipation, religion, and civil liberties to the challenges these issues continue to offer to Americans today.\n\nLincoln played many roles in his lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½lawyer, politician, presidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but in each he was driven by a core of values, convictions, and beliefs about economics, society, and democracy. Abraham Lincoln as a Man of Ideas is a broad and exciting survey of the ideas that made Lincoln great, just as we celebrate the bicentennial his birth.\n\n# Hardcover: 232 pages\n# Publisher: Southern Illinois University Press; 1st Edition edition (January 26, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0809328615\n# ISBN-13: 978-0809328611","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72088e1374df73109ba07cca23d020979c578e1e","amp;dn":"Abraham+Lincoln+as+a+Man+of+Ideas%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72088e1374df73109ba07cca23d020979c578e1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,8,142,19,116,223,115,16,155,160,124,202,35,208,32,151,156,87,142,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
