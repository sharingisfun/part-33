His creator, Conan Doyle, imbued his detective hero with intellectual power, acute observational abilities, a penchant for deductive reasoning and a highly educated use of forensic skills. Indeed, Doyle created the first fictional private detective who used what we now recognize as modern scientific investigative techniques.\n\nDoyle ended up writing four novels and 56 short stories featuring Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson. All but four are told in the first person by Watson, two by Holmes, and two are written in the third person. Together, this series of beautifully written Victorian literature has sold more copies than any other books in the English language, with the exceptions of the Bible and Shakespeare.\n\nVolume 1 in this series consists of two novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four, followed by a collection of short stories entitled The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. \n\nenjoy\nrkl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd1141801265c17cd2bba2df5954df43ce62f0e","amp;dn":"The+complete+storys+of+Sherlock+Homes+Volume+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd1141801265c17cd2bba2df5954df43ce62f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,209,20,24,1,38,92,23,205,43,186,45,245,149,77,244,60,230,47,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
