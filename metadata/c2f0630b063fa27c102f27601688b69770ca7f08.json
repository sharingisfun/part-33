Common to both of them though, is the songwriting genius of Jim Steinman--a man whose aptitude for hysterically overwrought melodrama knows no parallel this side of Andrew Lloyd-Webber. Bonnie's &quot;Holding Out For A Hero&quot; is about as close as we get here to the kind of pop song that might go unnoticed in a crowd. The same, of course, can't be said for &quot;Total Eclipse Of The Heart&quot; which manages to make feeling a bit horny sound as gigantically ominous as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Perhaps inevitably, it's Meat who steals the show: &quot;Bat Out Of Hell and &quot;I'll Do Anything For Love&quot; are tattooed on the folk psyche. It is, however, a delight to be reacquainted with &quot;Dead Ringer For Love&quot;, the scintillating mini-opera which, lest we forget, introduced Cher to a whole new generation of salivating adolescents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.93% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalogue #\t\t473666 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Bat Out Of Hell - Meat Loaf\n02.Faster Than The Speed Of Night - Bonnie Tyler\n03.You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth - Meat Loaf\n04.Have You Ever Seen The Rain? - Bonnie Tyler\n05.Read 'Em And Weep - Meat Loaf\n06.Total Eclipse Of The Heart - Bonnie Tyler\n07.Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad - Meat Loaf\n08.Holding Out For A Hero - Bonnie Tyler\n09.Dead Ringer For Love - Meat Loaf\n10.If You Were A Woman (And I Was A Man) - Bonnie Tyler\n11.If You Really Want To - Meat Loaf\n12.Straight From The Heart - Bonnie Tyler\n13.Loving You's A Dirty Job But Somebody's Gotta Do It - Bonnie Tyler\n14.Heaven Can Wait - Meat Loaf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2f0630b063fa27c102f27601688b69770ca7f08","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf++%2B+Bonnie+Tyler+-+Heaven+And+Hell+%281993%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2f0630b063fa27c102f27601688b69770ca7f08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,240,99,11,6,63,162,124,16,47,39,96,22,136,182,151,112,202,127,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
