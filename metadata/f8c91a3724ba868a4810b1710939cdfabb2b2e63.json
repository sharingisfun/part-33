Working in Nashville with session men and a few conscripted recruits (Al Kooper, Robbie Robertson), Dylan continued to bend minds with his warped lyrics and phrasing. Even dashed-off numbers such as &quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot; contribute to the crazed, fun-house ambiance. Dylan will never be this wild again.\n&lt;p&gt;\nNote: This is an mp4 encode of the new &quot;reissue&quot; version of BoB: Sound is superior, both when it comes the remix itself and the new mp4 standard. You may have to download a plugin to play this, but windows media player usually takes care of that automatically.\n&lt;/p&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c91a3724ba868a4810b1710939cdfabb2b2e63","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Blonde+On+Blonde+%28Reissue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c91a3724ba868a4810b1710939cdfabb2b2e63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,201,26,55,36,186,134,138,72,16,177,113,9,57,205,250,187,43,46,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
