But it turns out that most everyone, even many respected scholars, have the story all wrong. Captain William Kidd was no career cut-throat; he was a tough, successful New York sea captain who was hired to chase pirates. His three-year odyssey aboard the aptly named Adventure galley pitted him against arrogant Royal Navy commanders, jealous East India Company captains, storms, starvation, angry natives, and, above all, flesh-and-blood pirates. Superbly written and impeccably researched, The Pirate Hunter is one ripping good yarn.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d47839bde700aeab636f56a3fb04ccc452c4fd0f","amp;dn":"The+Pirate+Hunter+-+Richard+Zacks.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d47839bde700aeab636f56a3fb04ccc452c4fd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,120,57,189,231,0,174,171,99,111,86,163,251,4,204,196,82,196,253,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
