This is from the Displeased records D-00081 pressing.\n\nI left off the bonus track &quot;Into The Frost Of Winter&quot; because it's an early rehearsal recording and it sounds like it was recorded on a Fisher-Price tape recorder. It felt completely out of place on the album.\n\n1. In Mist She Was Standing\n2. Silhouette\n3. Forest Of October\n4. Under The Weeping Moon\n5. The Twilight Is My Robe\n6. Requiem\n7. The Apostle In Triumph\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b1279460631b52acfff0459c1011cd299413dd","amp;dn":"Opeth+-+Orchid+%28Vinyl+24-96%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b1279460631b52acfff0459c1011cd299413dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,177,39,148,96,99,27,82,172,255,240,69,156,16,17,205,41,148,19,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
