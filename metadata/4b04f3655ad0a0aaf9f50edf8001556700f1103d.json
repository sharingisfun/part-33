I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tell you what the word means. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like something from Lost.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So says Michael Benjamin Lerner, the bearded, bespectacled frontman (actually, he's the only member) of Telekinesis about the mysterious title of his fourth long-player, the puckish yet amiable, Merge-issued Dormarion. Actually, Dormarion is the name of the Austin, Texas street where he and Spoon drummer/producer Jim Eno, who mans the kit on the majority of songs here, spent countless hours putting together near perfect slabs of power pop-infused indie rock like &quot;Power Lines,&quot; &quot;Wires,&quot; and &quot;Dark to Light,&quot; and while the resulting record may not have the power to transcend time and space, it's got loads of charm and a captain who knows how to chart a streamlined course. \n\n  For the most part, Lerner sticks with the kind of convivial, Weezer-meets GBV power pop offerings that made the band's 2009 eponymous debut and 2011 sophomore outing Twelve Desperate Straight Lines so ripe for road tripping. This time around he's added a few more to the mix, like the blistering &quot;Empathetic People,&quot; the decidedly Beatles-esque &quot;Lean on Me,&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Power Lines,&quot; while tossing in a few curveballs like the sparse, melancholic sunset ballad &quot;Symphony&quot; and the excellent, moody, electro-tinged &quot;Ghosts and Creatures&quot; for good measure. The latter, at least sonically, opens up an entirely new world for the young singer/songwriter, one that four albums in, Lerner's Telekinesis, which has pretty much driven its current sound as far as it can go, might be wise to revisit in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b04f3655ad0a0aaf9f50edf8001556700f1103d","amp;dn":"Telekinesis+-+Dormarion+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b04f3655ad0a0aaf9f50edf8001556700f1103d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,4,243,101,90,208,160,170,249,245,14,223,128,1,85,103,0,241,16,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
