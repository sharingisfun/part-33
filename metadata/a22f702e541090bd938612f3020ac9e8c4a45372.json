Game &amp; movie was tested and works.\n\nTry 7Zip its free google it, if you don't have WinRar.\n\nThis is a CD Type Ps2 game so you must burn with CD-R Media only.\n(Verbatim recommened).\n\n\nNote: No Ps2 Backup disc/game or Copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is\n      Modded or if you use Swap Magic.\n\n\nYou could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games. Free Mc Boot won't work on newer models of ps2 you'll have to use an older version the tutorial explains this.\n\n-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou will also need to patch the iso (the PS2 game) with ESR disc patcher GUI v0.24a if your using free mc boot with ESR Elf to boot your p2 copies or backups (No-swapping required for esr method).\n\nAfter patching burn the iso with Imgburn or Dvd Decrypter to respectable media\nthen use the ESR through fmcb after you installed everything to boot your game.\n\nYou will still need to use the proper media for the game to run or load properly regardless if your using fmcb, a modded ps2, or swap magic. Try Verbatim DVD+R (Booktype to DVD-ROM), or Tayio Yuden, burn at 8x if its a 16x max. You really can't use Maxell DVD+R for example or some other brand as it more than likely will not work.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.\n\n\nThe Thing Duo Pack..Why not have the best of both worlds? Now you can watch the movie and be inspired to play the game! \n\nThere will be some delay when you load up the game after the ps2 logo but just be patient wait and the game will load, don't panic and think image is bogus its not. \n\nThe delay is the same as the original, its just the way the ps2 game was made so don't worry. \n\n\nGame Description:\n\nThe game begins where the movie ends.... After the enigmatic deaths of an American scientific expedition in the uncharted and frozen wastelands of the Antarctic, a military rescue team is sent in to investigate. Within these inhospitable surroundings the team encounters a strange shape-shifting alien life-form that assumes the appearance of people that it kills. The game brings fear and suspense to unimaginable levels, with a compelling plot and unique gameplay elements based upon action, evasion, trust and fear. Forget everything you ever learned about obliterating alien species with a simple barrage of violent ammunition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this monster is difficult to see, hard to kill, and seemingly impossible to evade. And when you actually see The Thing, \nitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s often too lateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nGame Pics included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% (Included in download).\n\nSet datatype setting to Playstation 2 and burn at 8x speed.\n\nUse Tayio Yuden or Verbatim CD-R Media for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n\nVerbatim is properly your best bet and should work just fine. \n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThe Thing DVD-Movie                                          Rel. 06/25/1982      \n\n\nDirector John Carpenter           \n\n\nStarring Kurt Russell\n\nFormat:        DVD5 NTSC\nLang.:         English\nDiscs:         1 \nMovie:         DVD-Video\nImage:         ISO\nRating:        R\nGenres:        Science Fiction/Fantasy, Suspense/Horror and Thriller.\nRequirements:  DVD Player, or PC DVD Player.\n\n\n\nMovie Description:\n\nThe stage is set for havoc and terror when a twelve-man research team finds an alien being that has fallen from the sky and has been buried for over 100,000 years. \n\n\n\nJust Burn the ISO with ImgBurn or another burning software to a DVD-R\nwatch with DVD Player or Pc DVD Player &amp; enjoy this great classic.\n\n\nPics included.\n\nAny problems or questions with game or movie post a comment.\n\nAlso if this is working for you let us know leave a comment.\n\nPlease Seed This when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, Do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a22f702e541090bd938612f3020ac9e8c4a45372","amp;dn":"The+Thing+%28Duo+Pack%29+%5BNtsc%5D+Ps2+Game+%2B+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a22f702e541090bd938612f3020ac9e8c4a45372","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,47,112,46,84,16,144,189,147,134,18,243,2,10,201,232,196,164,83,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
