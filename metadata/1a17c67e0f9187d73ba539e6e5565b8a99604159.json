These albums hinted, in their best moments, at Son Volt's potential to both write beautiful songs and rock out, but the band never seemed to completely let loose and turn it up to 11. Part of this may stem from their eclectic mix of musical influences. While the juxtaposition of styles ranging from country to bar-band rock &amp; roll has been the key to Son Volt's sound, it has also been a point of contention for those who have criticized them for not knowing what sort of band they wanted to be. Wide Swing Tremolo represents an attempt to somewhat break the mold of the earlier releases, especially from the intensely sparse Straightaways. Wide Swing Tremolo is a wide-open, rocking album with precious little of the overt country influences found on previous Son Volt works. Instead, this album is driven by R.E.M.-like arpeggio guitar riffs and muscular, warm rhythms. It's a strong album.\n\n01 Straightface             Farrar     3:02\n02 Driving the View         Farrar     2:57\n03 Jodel                    Farrar     :41\n04 Medicine Hat             Farrar     4:12\n05 Strands                  Farrar     5:06\n06 Flow                     Farrar     2:18\n07 Dead Man's Clothes       Farrar     2:46\n08 Right on Through         Farrar     3:08\n09 Chanty                   Farrar     1:27\n10 Carry You Down           Farrar     3:28\n11 Question                 Farrar     4:00\n12 Streets That Time Walks  Farrar     5:24\n13 Hanging Blue Side        Farrar     3:41\n14 Blind Hope               Farrar     3:17","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a17c67e0f9187d73ba539e6e5565b8a99604159","amp;dn":"Son+Volt+-+1998+-+Wide+Swing+Tremelo++%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a17c67e0f9187d73ba539e6e5565b8a99604159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,23,198,126,15,145,135,215,59,165,57,230,229,86,91,138,153,96,65,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
