New properties of textiles gained from nanosols are summarized and explained in a broad range, focusing on the mechanical and thermal stability, repellent properties, optical properties, antistatic coatings and bioactive coatings. An active discussion is held on the bioactive modifications, because this wide and interesting field offers a high potential for many new applications, e.g. in medicine. Besides basic research, this book will also provide examples on the transition of academic research to customer products","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e28196997db47616b50cd239c4c564314fc31a67","amp;dn":"Nanosols+and+Textiles+-+Boris+Mahltig%2C+Torsten+Textor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e28196997db47616b50cd239c4c564314fc31a67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,129,150,153,125,180,118,22,181,12,210,57,196,197,100,49,79,195,26,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
