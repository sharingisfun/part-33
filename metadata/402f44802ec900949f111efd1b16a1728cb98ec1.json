Nevertheless, process and extractive metallurgy are fields within their own right, and this work will be of interest to libraries supporting courses in the process area.\r\n\r\nSynthesizes the most pertinent contemporary developments within process metallurgy so scientists have authoritative information at their fingertips\r\nReplaces existing articles and monographs with a single complete solution, saving time for busy scientists\r\nHelps metallurgists to predict changes and consequences and create or modify whatever process is deployed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:402f44802ec900949f111efd1b16a1728cb98ec1","amp;dn":"Treatise+on+Process+Metallurgy+Vol.+1+-+Process+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"402f44802ec900949f111efd1b16a1728cb98ec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,47,68,128,46,201,0,148,159,17,30,253,27,22,161,114,140,185,142,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
