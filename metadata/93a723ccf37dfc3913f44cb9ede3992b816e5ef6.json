Reiner easily locates his target in the small Dordogne village of Taziac, but the hit is compromised when three innocent people are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Inspector Paul Mazarelle. Formerly of Paris but now living in Taziac, the inspector is charged with bringing his experience and record of success in the capital to bear on the gruesome quadruple homicide at the height of tourist season.\n\nBoth MazarelleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation and ReinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job become complicated when Molly, a New York City district attorney and daughter of two of the victims, arrives to identify the bodies and begins asking questions. All evidence points to Ali Sedak, a local Arab handyman, but Mazarelle and Molly have doubts, forcing Reiner to return to Taziac to ensure they see things as he arranged them. Little does anyone in the picturesque French countryside know how politically charged this crime is: its global ramifications, stemming from the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, could overshadow everything.\n\nTailored in crisp prose, this tantalizing and skillfully written thriller possesses all the luxury refinements of the best international intrigue. JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel chills, excites, and engrosses, pitting a smooth, calculating villain against an earthy, sympathetic Frenchman whose twilight career is suddenly heating up.\n\n&quot;JayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entertaining first novel pays homage to George Simenon and his legendary detective, Inspector Maigret.... The main draw is the charming, indomitable Inspector Mazarelle, who enjoys puffing on his old pipe, stopping for cognac in the middle of the day, and dining on sausages and lentils or his favorite dish, duck confit, at the CafÃƒÂ© Valon. Mystery fans will look forward to seeing more of him in the promised sequel.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers Weekly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93a723ccf37dfc3913f44cb9ede3992b816e5ef6","amp;dn":"The+Paris+Directive+-+by+Gerald+Jay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93a723ccf37dfc3913f44cb9ede3992b816e5ef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,167,35,204,243,125,252,57,19,244,76,185,237,227,153,43,129,110,94,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
